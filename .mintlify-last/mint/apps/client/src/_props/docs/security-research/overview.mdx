# Security & Research

<Callout type="info" icon="shield-halved">
  This section provides expert-level security analysis of dstack's TEE implementation. For general documentation, see our [Core Concepts](/docs/concepts/overview) section.
</Callout>

## For Security Researchers

dstack is built on a foundation of hardware-enforced security primitives. This section provides detailed technical analysis of each security-critical component, including:

* **Source code references** with direct links to implementation
* **Cryptographic protocol analysis** and trust boundaries
* **Attestation flow diagrams** and verification procedures
* **Key management architecture** and secure storage mechanisms

## Core Security Components

  <Card title="TDX Attestation" icon="fingerprint" href="/docs/security-research/tdx-attestation">
    Remote attestation implementation using Intel TDX hardware primitives
  </Card>

  <Card title="VMM Security" icon="server" href="/docs/security-research/vmm-security">
    Virtual Machine Manager security boundaries and isolation guarantees
  </Card>

  <Card title="KMS Architecture" icon="key" href="/docs/security-research/kms-security">
    Decentralized key management with hardware-backed secure storage
  </Card>

  <Card title="Gateway Protection" icon="shield" href="/docs/security-research/gateway-security">
    Secure ingress/egress with automated certificate management
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Verification Tools

```bash
# Verify attestation quote
tdx-attest verify --quote <quote-file>

# Inspect CVM measurements
dstack cvm measure --vm-id <id>

# Audit key derivation
kms audit --show-derivation
```

## Security Primitives

### Hardware Root of Trust

* Intel TDX provides CPU-based attestation
* Memory encryption with AES-NI hardware acceleration
* Secure boot chain from hardware to application

### Cryptographic Guarantees

* **Confidentiality**: AES-256-GCM for data at rest and in transit
* **Integrity**: SHA-384 for measurement and verification
* **Attestation**: ECDSA P-384 for quote signatures

### Trust Boundaries

```mermaid

    C -->|Secure Channel| D[KMS]
    C -->|TLS| E[Gateway]
    D -->|Key Derivation| F[Application]
```

## Component Deep Dives

Each component page includes:

* **Implementation analysis** with code walkthrough
* **Security properties** and threat model
* **Verification procedures** for auditors
* **GitHub source links** for direct code inspection

<Note>
  All security-critical code is open source and available at [github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack).

  <Step title="Automated Testing">
    Continuous fuzzing and property-based testing
  </Step>

  <Step title="Third-Party Audits">
    Periodic security assessments by external firms
  </Step>
</Steps>
