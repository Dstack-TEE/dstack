# Common image assembly

`assemble.sh` consumes the versioned manifest in
`../spec/artifact-manifest.schema.json`. It must not inspect a backend build
tree or invoke backend-specific tools such as BitBake.

The assembler creates the partitioned rootfs, metadata, measurement CBOR files,
unified digest, and release archives. Backend exporters may use symlinks for
large local artifacts; all paths recorded in the manifest itself are relative
to the manifest directory.
