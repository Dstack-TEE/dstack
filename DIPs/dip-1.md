## Abstract

This DIP defines `dip1`, a compact self-describing identifier that fits within the 64-byte Intel DCAP `reportdata` field. A fixed scope prefix (`dip1`) is followed by an algorithm label and either a digest or inline payload. The canonical form for hashed payloads is:

```
dip1:<algo>:<base64url-digest>
```

The actual payload, which encodes purpose/content-type metadata, is transmitted or embedded separately. An inline variant allows very small payloads to fit entirely inside the identifier.

## Motivation

Attestation workflows need a short, unambiguous identifier for application-defined data that can be carried inside `reportdata`. Without such structure, a verifier that receives a TDX quote can only check the quote envelope itself; it has no portable way to interpret what the embedded `reportdata` is supposed to prove.

By reserving the `dip1` prefix and standardising how algorithms and payload descriptors appear in the identifier, we make `reportdata` self-describing without exceeding the 64-byte budget. A verification platform can inspect the `dip1` string to learn which hash algorithm was used and what content type the payload represents, then route the quote to specialised validation plugins whenever they are available.

## Specification

The general grammar is:

```
dip1:<algo>:<data>
```

* `dip1`: Literal ASCII prefix reserving the namespace for this format.
* `<algo>`: Lowercase token indicating how to interpret `<data>`.
* `<data>`: Algorithm-dependent ASCII payload.

### Hashed payloads

For cryptographic digests:

```
dip1:sha256:<base64url-digest>
```

* `<base64url-digest>` is the URL-safe Base64 (unpadded) encoding of a SHA-256 digest (43 characters).
* The digest is computed over a canonical payload byte string supplied alongside the attestation evidence. The payload SHOULD begin with its own content-type prefix, e.g. `ratls-pubkey:<hex>`.
* Other algorithms MAY be supported in the future, but **SHA-256 is normative** for interoperability.

### Inline payloads

Short payloads can be embedded directly using the reserved `inline` algorithm:

```
dip1:inline:<type>:<base64url-payload>
```

* `<type>`: Short token (â‰¤8 characters recommended) describing the payload, e.g. `ra-pk`.
* `<base64url-payload>`: URL-safe Base64 (unpadded) encoding of the raw payload bytes.
* Inline payloads MUST keep the entire identifier within 64 bytes.

For maximal brevity, the `inline` algorithm MAY be omitted. The double-colon form is an alias for the inline variant:

```
dip1::<type>:<base64url-payload>
```

### Size considerations

For the SHA-256 variant:

* Prefix + separators: `dip1:` (5 chars) + second colon (1 char)
* Algorithm token: `sha256` (6 chars)
* Digest: 43 chars

Total: 55 characters, fitting comfortably within the 64-byte requirement.

For inline payloads, the combined length of `<type>` and `<base64url-payload>` MUST keep the string within 64 characters.

## Rationale

* Fixed namespace (`dip1`) prevents collisions with other project-defined encodings.
* Algorithm tag enables future extensions without ambiguity.
* Separating purpose metadata into the payload simplifies domain separation and allows richer payload structures.
* Base64url encoding maximises information density while remaining safe for textual channels.

## Implementation Notes

* Existing digest libraries can be reused by serialising payloads as `<algo>:<base64url>` before prefixing with `dip1:`.
* Canonical payload serialisation (e.g. `content-type:value`) should be specified by higher-level protocols.
* Inline payloads are best suited for small tokens such as capability flags or truncated keys.

## Security Considerations

* Security strength is determined by the chosen algorithm (SHA-256 recommended).
* Payload canonicalisation must be consistent to avoid digest mismatches.
* Inline payloads are not hashed; consumers must validate them according to application policy.
