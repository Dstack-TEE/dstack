## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

<div align="center">

<img src="./docs/assets/arch.png" alt="Architecture Diagram" height="300">

</div>

- **`dstack-vmm`**: A service running in a bare TDX host to manage CVMs
- **`dstack-gateway`**: A reverse proxy to forward TLS connections to CVMs
- **`dstack-kms`**: A KMS server to generate keys for CVMs
- **`dstack-guest-agent`**: A service running in CVM to serve containers' key derivation and attestation requests
- **`meta-dstack`**: A Yocto meta layer to build CVM guest images

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A bare metal TDX server setup following [canonical/tdx](https://github.com/canonical/tdx)
- Public IPv4 address assigned to the machine
- At least 16GB RAM, 100GB free disk space
- A domain with DNS access if you want to set up `dstack-gateway` for Zero Trust HTTPS

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Check the [Hardware Requirements](https://docs.phala.network/dstack/hardware-requirements) for more information on buying a bare metal server or renting a server from cloud providers.
> 
> If you are looking for a cloud-managed dstack, go to the docs to learn how to [sign up for a Phala Cloud Account](https://docs.phala.network/phala-cloud/getting-started/sign-up-for-cloud-account) and [deploy your first CVM on dstack](https://docs.phala.network/phala-cloud/getting-started/start-from-cloud-ui).

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# For Ubuntu 24.04
sudo apt install -y build-essential chrpath diffstat lz4 wireguard-tools xorriso

# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Build and Run

#### 1. Build the Artifacts

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/meta-dstack.git --recursive
cd meta-dstack/

mkdir build
cd build
../build.sh hostcfg
```

This outputs the following message:
```
Config file ../build-config.sh created, please edit it to configure the build
```

Review and customize the `build-config.sh` configuration file according to your environment requirements. The file contains network ports, domain settings, and other important parameters.

```bash
vim ./build-config.sh
```
Once configured, run the build script again to generate the necessary artifacts:

```bash
../build.sh hostcfg
```

If everything is okay, you should see the built artifacts in the `build` directory:

```bash
$ ls
certs  images  dstack-kms  kms.toml  run  dstack-vmm  vmm.toml  dstack-gateway  gateway.toml
```

#### 2. Download or Build Guest Image

**Option A: Download guest image**
```bash
# This will download the guest image from the release page
../build.sh dl 0.5.2
```

**Option B: Build from source**
```bash
# This will build the guest image from source using the yocto meta layer. This will take a while.
../build.sh guest
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note on Reproducible Builds**: The build command above does not guarantee reproducibility. For reproducible builds across different build environments, please refer to the [reproducible build instructions](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/meta-dstack?tab=readme-ov-file#reproducible-build-the-guest-image) in the meta-dstack repository.

#### 3. Run Components

Now you can open 3 terminals to start the components:

1. **KMS**: `./dstack-kms -c kms.toml`
2. **Gateway**: `sudo ./dstack-gateway -c gateway.toml`
3. **VMM**: `./dstack-vmm -c vmm.toml`

> [!WARNING]
> This configuration is for local development, and the kms is not secure. You should not use it in production. For production, you should follow the [deployment guide](./docs/deployment.md) and read the [security guide](./docs/security-guide/security-guide.md).

---

## üì± Usage

You can manage VMs via the dashboard or [CLI](./docs/vmm-cli-user-guide.md).

### Deploy an App

Open the dstack-vmm webpage [http://localhost:9080](http://localhost:9080) (change the port according to your configuration) on your local machine to deploy a `docker-compose.yaml` file:

<div align="center">

<img src="./docs/assets/vmm.png" alt="VMM Interface" height="400">

</div>

After the container is deployed, it should take some time to start the CVM and the containers. Time would be vary depending on your workload.

- **[Logs]**: Click the button to see the logs of the CVM, you can see if the container is finished starting there
- **[Dashboard]**: Once the container is running, you can click the button to see some information about the container. The logs of the containers can be seen in the Dashboard page

<div align="center">

<img src="./docs/assets/guest-agent.png" alt="Guest Agent Dashboard" height="300">

</div>

- **Gateway Dashboard**: You can open dstack-gateway's dashboard at [https://localhost:9070](https://localhost:9070) to see the CVM's wireguard ip address:

<div align="center">

<img src="./docs/assets/gateway.png" alt="Gateway Dashboard" height="150">

</div>

### Pass Secrets to Apps

When deploying a new App, you can pass private data via Encrypted Environment Variables. These variables can be referenced in the docker-compose.yaml file as shown below:

<div align="center">

<img src="./docs/assets/secret.png" alt="Secret Management" height="300">

</div>

The environment variables will be encrypted in the client-side and decrypted in the CVM before being passed to the containers.

### Access the App

Once the app is deployed and listening on an HTTP port, you can access the HTTP service via dstack-gateway's public domain. The ingress mapping rules are:

- `<id>[s].<base_domain>` maps to port `80` or `443` if with `s` in the CVM
- `<id>-<port>[s].<base_domain>` maps to port `<port>` in the CVM

**Example**: `3327603e03f5bd1f830812ca4a789277fc31f577-8080.app.kvin.wang` maps to port `8080` in the CVM.

Where the `<id>` can be either the app id or the instance id. If the app id is used, one of the instances will be selected by the load balancer. If the `id-port` part ends with `s`, it means the TLS connection will be passthrough to the app rather than terminating at dstack-gateway.

You can also ssh into the CVM to inspect more information, if your deployment uses the image `dstack-x.x.x-dev`:

```bash
# The IP address of the CVM can be found in the dstack-gateway dashboard
ssh root@10.0.3.2
```

### Getting TDX Quote in Docker Container

To get a TDX quote within app containers:

**1. Mount the socket in `docker-compose.yaml`**

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/run/dstack.sock:/var/run/dstack.sock
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    restart: always
```

**2. Execute the quote request command**

```bash
# The argument report_data accepts binary data encoding in hex string.
# The actual report_data passing the to the underlying TDX driver is sha2_256(report_data).
curl --unix-socket /var/run/dstack.sock http://localhost/GetQuote?report_data=0x1234deadbeef | jq .  
```

### Container Logs

Container logs can be obtained from the CVM's `dashboard` page or by curl:

```bash
curl 'http://<appid>.app.kvin.wang:9090/logs/<container name>?since=0&until=0&follow=true&text=true&timestamps=true&bare=true'
```

Replace `<appid>` and `<container name>` with actual values. Available parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `since=0` | Starting Unix timestamp for log retrieval |
| `until=0` | Ending Unix timestamp for log retrieval |
| `follow` | Enables continuous log streaming |
| `text` | Returns human-readable text instead of base64 encoding |
| `timestamps` | Adds timestamps to each log line |
| `bare` | Returns the raw log lines without json format |

**Example response:**
```bash
$ curl 'http://0.0.0.0:9190/logs/zk-provider-server?text&timestamps'
{"channel":"stdout","message":"2024-09-29T03:05:45.209507046Z Initializing Rust backend...\n"}
{"channel":"stdout","message":"2024-09-29T03:05:45.209543047Z Calling Rust function: init\n"}
{"channel":"stdout","message":"2024-09-29T03:05:45.209544957Z [2024-09-29T03:05:44Z INFO  rust_prover] Initializing...\n"}
{"channel":"stdout","message":"2024-09-29T03:05:45.209546381Z [2024-09-29T03:05:44Z INFO  rust_prover::groth16] Starting setup process\n"}
```

### TLS Passthrough with Custom Domain

dstack-gateway supports TLS passthrough for custom domains.

See the example [here](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack-examples/tree/main/custom-domain/dstack-ingress) for more details.

### Upgrade an App

Got to the dstack-vmm webpage, click the **[Upgrade]** button, select or paste the compose file you want to upgrade to, and click the **[Upgrade]** button again. The app id does not change after the upgrade. Stop and start the app to apply the upgrade.

---

## üîê Advanced Features

### Zero Trust HTTPS

In the tutorial above, we used a TLS certificate with a private key external to the TEE. To establish trust, we need to generate and maintain the certificate's private key within the TEE and provide evidence that all TLS certificates for the domain originated solely from dstack-gateway CVM.

By combining Certificate Transparency Logs and CAA DNS records, we can make the best effort to minimize security risks. Here's our approach:

- Set CAA records to allow only the account created in dstack-gateway CVM to request Certificates
- Launch a program to monitor Certificate Transparency Log and give alarm once any certificate issued to a pubkey that isn't generated by dstack-gateway CVM

#### Configurations

To launch Certbot, you need to own a domain hosted on Cloudflare. Obtain an API token with DNS operation permissions from the Cloudflare dashboard. Configure it in the `build-config.sh`:

```bash
# The directory to store the auto obtained TLS certificate and key
GATEWAY_CERT=${CERBOT_WORKDIR}/live/cert.pem
GATEWAY_KEY=${CERBOT_WORKDIR}/live/key.pem

# For certbot
CF_ZONE_ID=cc0a40...
CF_API_TOKEN=g-DwMH...
# ACME_URL=https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
ACME_URL=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```

Then re-run the build script:

```bash
../build.sh
```

#### Launch Certbot

Then run the certbot in the `build/` and you will see the following log:

```text

**What the command does:**

- Registered to letsencrypt and got a new account `https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/acct/168601853`
- Auto set CAA records for the domain on cloudflare, you can open the CF dashboard to see the record:

<div align="center">

<img src="./docs/assets/certbot-caa.png" alt="Certbot CAA" height="300">

</div>

- Auto requested a new certificate from Let's Encrypt. Automatically renews the certificate to maintain its validity

#### Launch dstack-gateway

Execute dstack-gateway with `sudo ./dstack-gateway -c gateway.toml`, then access the web portal to check the dstack-gateway CVM managed Let's Encrypt account. The account's private key remains securely sealed within the TEE.

<img src="./docs/assets/gateway-accountid.png" alt="Gateway Account ID" height="300">

</div>

### Certificate Transparency Log Monitor

To enhance security, we've limited TLS certificate issuance to dstack-gateway via CAA records. However, since these records can be modified through Cloudflare's domain management, we need to implement global CA certificate monitoring to maintain security oversight.

`ct_monitor` tracks Certificate Transparency logs via [https://crt.sh](https://crt.sh/?q=app.kvin.wang), comparing their public key with the ones got from dstack-gateway RPC. It immediately alerts when detecting unauthorized certificates not issued through dstack-gateway:

```text

## üîí Security

dstack undergoes regular security audits to ensure the highest standards of security for TEE-based deployments.

### Security Audit Report

A comprehensive security audit was conducted to evaluate the security architecture and implementation of dstack. The audit report is available at:

üìÑ **[Security Audit Report](./docs/security/dstack-audit.pdf)**

The audit covers key security aspects including:
- TEE integration and attestation mechanisms
- Cryptographic implementations and key management
- Network security and TLS configurations
- Container isolation and runtime security
- Smart contract security (for blockchain integrations)

For additional security guidance and best practices, see the [Security Guide](./docs/security-guide/security-guide.md).

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Error: qemu-system-x86_64: vhost-vsock: unable to set guest cid: Address already in use

`dstack-vmm` may throw this error when creating a new VM if the [Unix Socket CID](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vsock.7.html) is occupied.

**Solution:**

1. **List the occupied CID:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep 'guest-cid='
   ```

2. **Choose a new range** of the CID not conflicting with the CID in use. You can change `build/vmm.toml` file and restart `dstack-vmm`. For example, you may find 33000-34000 free to use:
   ```toml
   [cvm]
   cid_start = 33000
   cid_pool_size = 1000
   ```

3. **When building from scratch**, change the CID configs in `build-config.sh` instead, because `vmm.toml` file is generated by `build.sh`.

> [!NOTE]
> You may encounter this problem when upgrading from an older version of dstack, because CID was introduced in `build-config.sh` in later versions. In such case, please follow the docs to add the missing entries in `build-config.sh` and rebuild dstack.

### Error: Operation not permitted when building guest image

When running `../build.sh guest`, you might encounter this error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/meta-dstack/poky/bitbake/bin/bitbake-worker", line 278, in child
    bb.utils.disable_network(uid, gid)
  File "/meta-dstack/poky/bitbake/lib/bb/utils.py", line 1696, in disable_network
    with open("/proc/self/uid_map", "w") as f:
PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted
```

**Solution:**

This error occurs because Ubuntu 23.10 and later versions restrict unprivileged user namespaces by default.

```bash
