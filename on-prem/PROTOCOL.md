# Protocol at a glance (on-prem private deployment)

The cryptographic protocol behind the deployment — **what message carries what, and
what is verified at each hop**. This is the **cloud-agnostic core** (authority /
key-broker / launcher; see [`README.md`](README.md)); the measurements shown use the GCP
**TDX+vTPM** profile (`key_provider=tpm`, internal-IP cert SAN). For commands see
[`gcp/QUICKSTART.md`](gcp/QUICKSTART.md); for the operational walkthrough see
[`gcp/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`](gcp/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).

## Actors & trust roots

| Actor | Where | Holds / proves |
|---|---|---|
| **Authority** | vendor host (online) | Ed25519 **AuthBundle signing key** (its pubkey = `AUTHORITY_PUBKEY`, the **root of authz trust**, pinned into the measured KMS compose); per-tenant **KMS root** (P-256 root-CA + secp256k1 k256); **global image keyring** (EC P-256 private keys) |
| **Verifier** | vendor host | validates the TDX+vTPM quote, replays the event log, extracts `os_image_hash` / `compose_hash` / `key_provider` / `tcb_status` / `report_data` |
| **Courier CLI** (`kms_ctl.py` / `dstack-cloud`) | operator host | **untrusted relay** — moves opaque blobs between Authority and the CVM. Never a trust anchor |
| **key-broker** | inside KMS CVM (TEE) | terminates the courier; HPKE-opens the sealed root; verifies the AuthBundle; materializes the KMS keyset; serves `bootAuth` + `lease` to workloads |
| **dstack-kms** | inside KMS CVM (TEE) | boots from the materialized keyset, serves TLS `:8000`, derives per-app keys |
| **launcher** | inside workload CVM (TEE) | RA-TLS client to the key-broker; leases the image keyring; decrypts the JWE image; runs + supervises the workload |
| **guest-agent** | inside each CVM | produces the TDX+vTPM attestation and binds it to `report_data` |

**Trust spine:** the vendor controls one secret (the Ed25519 signing key). Its public
half is *measured into* the KMS compose, so a tampered Authority cannot forge an
AuthBundle, and a tampered compose changes `compose_hash` and is rejected at provision.

---

## Phase 0 — Vendor onboarding (one-time setup + per-customer account)

Goal: mint the trust anchors that Phases A/B consume, and **open an account for each
customer**. This is all the vendor's offline/admin work — no attestation yet.

**A. One-time vendor setup** (`deploy-authority.sh`, `vendor-release.sh`)

1. **Authority bootstrap** — generate/persist the Ed25519 signing key → `AUTHORITY_PUBKEY`.
2. **Mint the global image keyring** — `POST /admin/keys {kid}` → EC P-256 keypair; the
   private half never leaves the Authority.
3. **Encrypt + push images** — `skopeo copy --encryption-key jwe:pub.pem` (public key only).
4. **Register global policy** — `POST /admin/os-images {hash}` (read from the published OS
   release's `auth_hash.txt`) and `POST /admin/kms-compose-hashes {hash}` (the computed KMS
   `compose_hash`).
5. **Pin templates** — write `AUTHORITY_PUBKEY` + image digests + `app_id` *literally* into
   the **measured** composes. This is the step that **measures the trust root into**
   `compose_hash`, so a later tamper changes the hash and is rejected.

**B. Per-customer account / 开户** (`vendor-add-tenant.sh <user_id>`)

6. `POST /admin/users {user_id}` → returns a **tenant API key** (shown once) and mints that
   tenant's **own `root_material`** (P-256 root-CA + secp256k1 k256, independent per tenant).
7. `POST /admin/users/{user_id}/images {app_id, allowed_launcher_digests, image_digest}` →
   registers the app into **this tenant's** whitelist (`allowed_launcher_digests` = the
   launcher's measured `compose_hash`; `allowed_workload_digests` = the workload image digest).

**Handoff to that customer's operator:** ① the 4 images in `$PUBREG`; ② the pin-filled
`deploy/kms` + `deploy/launcher`; ③ `AUTHORITY_PUBKEY`; ④ the **tenant API key**.

| Produced in Phase 0 | Consumed at |
|---|---|
| `AUTHORITY_PUBKEY` (measured into the compose) | **G7** — key-broker verifies the AuthBundle signature |
| tenant API key | Phase A `challenge`/`provision` — authenticates the courier *as* `user_id` |
| per-tenant `root_material` | Phase A — HPKE-sealed to the KMS as `sealed_root` |
| global image keyring (private keys) | Phase B — leased to the attested launcher to decrypt |
| os-image hash whitelist | **G4** |
| KMS compose-hash whitelist | **G6** |
| app whitelist (`app_id` + launcher/workload digests) | **G9 / G10 / G11** |

The tenant API key is the only thing that selects *which* account a provision draws from:
it authenticates the courier as `user_id`, and the Authority ships **that tenant's whole app
whitelist** (§ "which app_ids" — narrowed per-app later, at the workload's lease, by G9).

---

## Phase A — KMS provisioning (courier attest)

Goal: hand the KMS its root key **without the operator ever seeing it**, and only to a
CVM the vendor has cryptographically approved.

```

1. **challenge** — CLI authenticates with its tenant API key; Authority returns a
   stateless HMAC `nonce` (TTL-bounded).
2. **courier/init** — the key-broker mints a **per-session X25519 transport keypair**,
   stamps `kms_ts`, computes
   `report_data = SHA-512(nonce ‖ transport_pub ‖ kms_ts_LE)` (64 B), and asks the
   guest-agent for a full **TDX + vTPM** attestation over that `report_data`. Returns
   `transport_pub`, `kms_ts`, the attestation, and `vm_config`.
3. **provision** — Authority replays the nonce (MAC + TTL), checks clock skew ≤ 300 s,
   sends the attestation to the Verifier, and runs the six fail-closed gates (G1–G6
   below) on the returned verdict.
   On success it **HPKE-seals** the root payload (P-256 root-CA key + k256 scalar +
   domain) **to `transport_pub`** → `sealed_root`, bumps `bundle_seq`, and **Ed25519-signs**
   the AuthBundle (app whitelist + global image keyring + os-image whitelist + revocations).
4. **courier/install** — the key-broker **verifies the AuthBundle signature** against the
   compose-pinned `AUTHORITY_PUBKEY`, enforces **`bundle_seq` strictly increasing**
   (anti-rollback), **HPKE-opens** `sealed_root` with the session transport secret (only
   this TEE holds it), sets the **rpc-cert SAN to the CVM's own internal IP**, materializes
   the dstack-kms keyset (`root-ca` / `tmp-ca` / `rpc` / `k256`), and writes `_ready`.
5. **boot** — dstack-kms's wait-loop sees `_ready`, exec's, and serves TLS on `:8000`.
   At its own boot it calls the key-broker `bootAuth/kms`, which **re-checks** os-image +
   tcb + device fail-closed.

The operator's CLI only ever holds two **opaque** blobs (`sealed_root`, `auth_bundle`).
G2 is the anti-substitution lynchpin: a genuine quote that isn't bound to *our*
`transport_pub` is rejected, so the relaying CLI cannot swap in a key it controls.

---

## Phase B — Workload launch (RA-TLS lease)

Goal: a workload CVM gets the image-decryption keys **only after re-proving** its
identity to the (now-running) KMS, and loses them if it stops re-proving.

```
 launcher(workload CVM)        key-broker(KMS CVM)
  │───────bootAuth/app(BootInfo)───────▶│
  │                                     │ os_image✓ tcb✓ app_id✓ compose✓ device✓
  │◀──────────────allowed───────────────│
  │──────────RA-TLS handshake──────────▶│
  │                                     │ mutual; launcher cert embeds TDX quote

  │                                     │ re-run gates; digest ∈ allowed_workload_digests
  │                                     │ bind slot_id → (instance, compose)
  │◀──────Lease(signed) + keyset────────│
  │  write privkeys → tmpfs             │
  │  ocicrypt JWE decrypt(image@digest) │
  │  run decrypted workload             │
  │─────lease/renew  (every ttl/3)─────▶│
  │  renew fail → re-acquire            │
  │  (re-runs every gate)               │
  │  past grace → stop workload         │
```

1. **bootAuth/app** — before anything decrypts, the key-broker gates the boot on the
   measured `BootInfo` (os-image, tcb, app_id, compose_hash, device).
2. **RA-TLS** — mutual TLS where the launcher's client cert **embeds its TDX quote**, so
   the key-broker authenticates the *hardware*, not a bearer token.
3. **lease/acquire** — re-runs the auth gates, additionally requires
   `image_digest ∈ app.allowed_workload_digests`, **binds a `slot_id`** to
   `(instance_id, compose_hash)` (anti-clone), and returns a **signed Lease + the keyset**
   (the global image private keys).
4. **decrypt + run** — the launcher hands every leased private key to `skopeo`; ocicrypt
   (native JWE, ECDH-ES) decrypts with whichever key is the image's recipient, then runs it.
5. **renew** — every `ttl/3` the launcher renews; a renewal failure triggers a full
   re-acquire (re-running **all** gates against the live AuthBundle); if that still fails
   past the grace window the workload containers are **stopped** — entitlement is
   continuous, not one-shot.

### Phase B (day-2) — hot workload update

The workload image **digest is not measured** (only its name + `app_id` are), so a new
version is a hot rolling update — no new `compose_hash`, no CVM rebuild. The vendor drives
it; the launcher applies it on its next poll.

```
vendor                operator             key-broker           launcher
  │ encrypt new image     │                     │                   │

  │──re-signed bundle++──▶│                     │                   │
  │                       │───courier/install──▶│                   │
  │                       │                     │ verify sig (G7)   │
  │                       │                     │ bundle_seq↑ (G8)  │
  │                       │ mirror image → AR   │                   │
  │                       │                     │◀──poll /version───│
  │                       │                     │──current digest──▶│
  │                       │                     │◀──lease/acquire───│
  │                       │                     │ G11: ∈allowed     │
  │                       │                     │──Lease + keyset──▶│
  │                       │                     │                   │ decrypt + rolling
  │                       │                     │                   │ health 60s→rollback
```

`vendor-release.sh` + `vendor-add-tenant.sh` (vendor) → `operator-deploy.sh update`
(operator: mirror image + `sync-auth`). **G11** is the only thing that admits a new digest
(vendor-controlled); **G8** rejects any downgrade. The root key is never re-provisioned —
`sync-auth` swaps authorization data only.

---

## Fail-closed gates (the whole policy surface)

| # | Gate | Enforced at | Rejects when… |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | quote authentic | Authority/Verifier | the TDX+vTPM quote isn't hardware-rooted |
| G2 | `report_data` binding | Authority | quote not bound to this session's `transport_pub`/nonce |
| G3 | tcb status | Authority **+** key-broker | tcb ∉ allowed (empty/missing ⇒ deny) |
| G4 | os-image hash | Authority **+** key-broker | os-image ∉ whitelist (**empty ⇒ deny**) |
| G5 | key_provider == `tpm` | Authority | disk not vTPM-sealed (`kms`/`local`/`none`) |
| G6 | KMS compose hash | Authority | compose ∉ kms-compose whitelist (**empty ⇒ deny**) |
| G7 | AuthBundle signature | key-broker | sig ≠ pinned `AUTHORITY_PUBKEY` |
| G8 | `bundle_seq` monotonic | key-broker | `new_seq ≤ stored_seq` (rollback) |
| G9 | app_id ∈ whitelist | key-broker | app not registered for this tenant |
| G10 | launcher compose hash | key-broker | compose ∉ `allowed_launcher_digests` / revoked |
| G11 | workload image digest | key-broker | digest ∉ `allowed_workload_digests` |
| G12 | lease alive | launcher | renew + re-acquire fail past grace ⇒ stop workload |

Every list-based gate denies on the **empty** list — an unconfigured policy is a *closed*
policy, never an open one.

## Cryptographic primitives

- **Quote binding** — `report_data = SHA-512(nonce ‖ transport_pub ‖ kms_ts_LE)`; the
  same formula is recomputed by the Authority (G2). Ties one specific quote to one
  specific session transport key.
- **Root sealing** — HPKE (RFC 9180): `DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256)` + `HKDF-SHA256` +
  `AES-256-GCM`, base mode, `info = "dstack-courier-root-v1"`. Sealed to the per-session
  `transport_pub`; openable only inside the TEE that minted it.
- **AuthBundle** — Ed25519 over canonical (`sort_keys`, compact) JSON; verified against
  the `AUTHORITY_PUBKEY` **measured into** the KMS compose; `bundle_seq` strictly
  monotonic for anti-rollback.
- **Image encryption** — ocicrypt **native JWE** (ECDH-ES, EC P-256). Encrypt with the
  **public key only** (`skopeo copy --encryption-key jwe:pub.pem`); the build host never
  holds a decryption secret. Private keys are leased to attested launchers, which
  `--decryption-key` them; ocicrypt try-each-matches the recipient.
- **KMS root** — P-256 root-CA (the KMS KDF extracts its scalar to derive every app/disk/env
  key) + secp256k1 k256 (identity signatures). Authority-held for DR; HPKE-sealed per provision.

## Trust boundaries (read this twice)

- **HPKE protects the KMS root end-to-end** — `sealed_root` is confidential to the
  destination TEE, so the relaying operator never sees the KMS root or any derived key.
- **The AuthBundle is integrity-protected, not encrypted.** It is signed (G7) so the
  operator cannot *forge* or *alter* it, but its `keyring` (the global image private keys)
  travels **in cleartext** through the courier relay. So the operator who provisions the
  KMS is **inside the image-confidentiality boundary** — image encryption defends against
  the registry, the network, and image-at-rest, **not** against that operator. This is
  consistent with the design's stated v2 tradeoff ("the platform/vendor can decrypt
  customer data"); if your threat model needs to exclude the operator from image keys too,
  the bundle's `keyring` must additionally be HPKE-sealed to `transport_pub`.
- **Transport to the Authority is not part of the cryptographic protocol — secure it
  separately.** The operator reaches the Authority at `AUTHORITY_URL` (FastAPI, **plaintext
  `:8083`** by default) and authenticates with its **tenant API key as a bearer token**. The
  protocol guarantees above hold even over a hostile network (root stays HPKE-sealed, bundle
  stays Ed25519-signed, the quote stays bound by `report_data`) — but the **API key** and the
  cleartext **bundle keyring** are exposed to anyone on-path. So a remote operator MUST reach
  the Authority over **TLS** (`AUTHORITY_URL=https://…`, fronted by a reverse proxy / LB);
  plaintext `http://` is only for same-host or a trusted private network. The admin API
  (`AUTHORITY_ADMIN_TOKEN`) is likewise bearer-authed and must not be exposed in the clear.
