# DStack Core Components Overview

This page provides an overview of dstack's core components and guides you through understanding their technical implementation. Each component plays a crucial role in creating secure, confidential computing environments.

For a high-level conceptual overview, start with [Basic Components](/docs/concepts/basic-components). This page focuses on the technical implementation details and how components interact.

## Component Responsibilities

### Host Components (Run on Physical Host)

**VMM (Virtual Machine Manager)**
- Orchestrates CVM lifecycle and resource allocation
- Provides RPC API, Host API, Guest API, and Web UI interfaces
- Manages VM networking, storage, and GPU passthrough
- Integrates with KMS for secure boot processes

**Gateway (Network Proxy)**  
- Handles TLS termination and WireGuard VPN connections
- Routes external traffic to CVMs using domain-based routing
- Manages certificate provisioning and renewal via Let's Encrypt
- Provides cluster synchronization for high availability

**KMS (Key Management Service)**
- Provides enterprise-grade cryptographic services with blockchain integration
- Supports three boot modes: Non-KMS, Local-Key-Provider, and KMS
- Handles remote attestation and key distribution
- Manages certificate authority and signing operations

### CVM Components (Run Inside Confidential VMs)

**dstack-os (Operating System)**
- Minimal, secure Linux foundation with TDX attestation
- Provides secure boot process with UEFI and measured boot
- Handles full disk encryption initialization
- Manages system services and container runtime

**tdxctl (TDX Control Utility)**
- Provides secure boot and encryption utilities
- Handles full disk encryption setup with LUKS
- Manages Runtime Measurement Register (RTMR) extensions
- Supports data sealing and attestation operations

**Guest Agent (Runtime Services)**
- Manages container lifecycle using containerd
- Provides security services including attestation and key derivation
- Exposes REST API via Unix socket for application integration
- Handles registration with Gateway and KMS services

## DStack Implementation Path

To understand dstack's implementation in detail, follow this recommended reading order:

1. **[VMM Core](/docs/concepts/core-vmm)** - Start here to understand VM orchestration and lifecycle management
2. **[Gateway Core](/docs/concepts/core-gateway)** - Learn about network routing, TLS, and WireGuard VPN
3. **[KMS Core](/docs/concepts/core-kms)** - Dive into key management, attestation, and cryptographic services  
4. **[Guest Agent Core](/docs/concepts/core-guest-agent)** - Understand container management and runtime services
5. **[TDXctl Core](/docs/concepts/core-tdxctl)** - Explore TDX utilities and secure boot processes
6. **[OS Core](/docs/concepts/core-os)** - Learn about the minimal secure operating system foundation

Each component page provides detailed configuration examples, API references, and operational guidance.
