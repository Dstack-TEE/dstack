## **Guest Agent Architecture Overview**

The dstack guest agent implements a multi-service architecture designed for high availability and security within trusted execution environments. [2](#0-1)  The service operates four concurrent server components that handle different aspects of system functionality while maintaining strict security boundaries and ensuring robust operation under various operational conditions.

**Service Initialization and Management**

The guest agent employs a sophisticated initialization sequence that ensures all critical services are available before accepting requests. [3](#0-2)  Each service component runs independently with dedicated error handling and graceful degradation capabilities, ensuring that failure in one component does not compromise the entire system's security posture or operational capability.

**Application State Management**

Central to the guest agent's operation is the AppState management system that maintains critical security context and configuration data. [4](#0-3)  This state includes cryptographic keys, application composition configuration, certificate management clients, and VM-specific configuration that enables secure and verifiable operation within the TDX environment.

## **Security Architecture and Attestation Services**

**TDX Quote Generation and Verification**

The guest agent implements comprehensive TDX attestation capabilities that enable remote parties to verify the integrity and authenticity of the execution environment. [5](#0-4)  The attestation system supports both raw quote generation for low-level operations and structured quote generation with hash-based report data processing, providing flexibility for different security requirements and use cases.

**Runtime Measurement Register (RTMR) Management**

RTMR extension capabilities allow applications to record security-relevant events that become part of the attestation evidence. [6](#0-5)  This functionality is essential for maintaining a verifiable chain of custody for application operations and ensuring that all security-relevant state changes are recorded in the hardware-protected measurement registers.

**Cryptographic Key Derivation Services**

The guest agent provides sophisticated key derivation services based on the application's cryptographic identity and attestation state. [7](#0-6)  These services enable applications to derive unique cryptographic keys for specific purposes while maintaining verifiable links to the application's identity and the integrity of the execution environment.

**TLS Certificate Management**

Automated TLS certificate generation and management ensures secure communication channels for application services. [8](#0-7)  The certificate authority integration allows for both standard TLS certificates and Remote Attestation TLS (RA-TLS) certificates that embed attestation evidence directly in the certificate chain, enabling clients to verify both the communication channel and the execution environment simultaneously.

## **Container Lifecycle and Runtime Management**

**Docker Integration and Container Operations**

The guest agent maintains comprehensive integration with the container runtime environment, providing detailed visibility into container operations and lifecycle management. [9](#0-8)  This integration enables real-time monitoring of application containers, including state tracking, resource utilization monitoring, and operational health assessment that supports both automated management and manual troubleshooting scenarios.

**Application Composition Processing**

Container deployment is managed through structured application composition files that define the complete application stack configuration. [10](#0-9)  The guest agent processes these compositions to ensure proper container configuration, networking setup, and security policy enforcement while maintaining auditability of the deployment configuration through cryptographic hashing and attestation integration.

**Log Management and Monitoring**

Comprehensive logging capabilities provide detailed visibility into container operations while respecting privacy and security requirements. [11](#0-10)  The logging system supports real-time streaming, historical log retrieval, and flexible filtering options that enable effective debugging and operational monitoring without compromising sensitive data or security boundaries.

## **System Monitoring and Health Services**

**Resource Monitoring and Metrics Collection**

The guest agent implements detailed system monitoring capabilities that track CPU utilization, memory usage, disk space, and network activity across the guest environment. [12](#0-11)  These metrics support both operational monitoring and capacity planning while providing essential data for automated scaling and resource management decisions.

Network monitoring capabilities provide comprehensive visibility into network configuration, traffic patterns, and connectivity status. [13](#0-12)  The system tracks both standard network interfaces and specialized secure communication channels, ensuring that network connectivity issues can be quickly identified and resolved while maintaining security isolation requirements.

**Watchdog and Health Check Services**

Integrated watchdog functionality ensures system reliability and enables integration with systemd service management. [14](#0-13)  The health check system continuously monitors service availability and can automatically trigger recovery procedures when anomalies are detected, ensuring high availability and reliable operation in production environments.

## **Communication Interfaces and API Services**

**RPC Service Architecture**

The guest agent implements multiple RPC interfaces designed for different security contexts and operational requirements. [15](#0-14)  These interfaces provide structured access to attestation services, cryptographic operations, and system management functions while maintaining appropriate security boundaries and access controls for different categories of clients and operations.

**External HTTP Interface and Dashboard**

A comprehensive web-based dashboard provides operational visibility and management capabilities for authorized users. [16](#0-15)  The dashboard interface supports both human operators and automated tools, providing access to system status, container information, and operational metrics while respecting privacy and security configuration settings.

**VSOCK Communication Channel**

Secure host-guest communication is facilitated through VSOCK interfaces that provide isolation and security guarantees. [17](#0-16)  This communication channel enables secure coordination between the host system and guest environment while maintaining the security boundaries essential for trusted execution environments.

## **Operational Security and Governance**

**Application Information and Identity Management**

The guest agent maintains comprehensive application identity information that enables verification of application authenticity and operational context. [18](#0-17)  This information includes application identifiers, instance information, device identification, and cryptographic evidence that supports both operational management and security verification requirements.

**Configuration Security and Integrity**

All configuration data is processed with integrity verification and security validation to ensure that only authorized and verified configurations can be deployed. [19](#0-18)  The configuration system supports both development and production scenarios while maintaining strict security controls and auditability requirements that are essential for production deployment scenarios.

The dstack guest agent represents a sophisticated and comprehensive solution for secure container orchestration within trusted execution environments.
