# Core Concepts Overview

This page provides an overview of the core concepts that form the foundation of dstack.

## Basic Concepts

- Source code
- Configuration files
- Deployment settings
- Resources

### Environments

dstack supports multiple environments such as:

- Development
- Staging
- Production

Each environment can have its own configuration and resources.

### Resources

Resources are the infrastructure components used by your application:

- Compute instances
- Databases
- Storage
- Networking components

## Workflow Concepts

### Build Process

The build process in dstack includes:

1. Source code compilation
2. Dependency resolution
3. Asset bundling
4. Artifact creation

### Deployment

Deployment in dstack involves:

1. Provisioning resources
2. Configuring environments
3. Deploying application artifacts
4. Setting up monitoring and scaling
