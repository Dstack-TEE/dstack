# DStack System Architecture

This page provides a technical overview of dstack’s system architecture—detailing how each component contributes to secure, scalable, and verifiable container deployments. dstack is designed to transform standard containers into confidential workloads using hardware-backed isolation, decentralized trust, and zero-trust networking.

Here, you’ll find a breakdown of how dstack’s components interact: from user interfaces and orchestration layers to security services and confidential VMs. The architecture emphasizes cryptographic verification at every stage, secure VM orchestration, and robust management of secrets and network boundaries.


### We started off by Establishing Trusted vs Untrusted Boundaries

In this architecture, trust boundaries are established to clearly delineate which components are considered secure and which are not. Trusted systems are those whose integrity and confidentiality are maintained through hardware-based security features, such as Intel TDX, cryptographic verification, and measured boot processes. These mechanisms ensure that only authorized and verified code is executed, and that sensitive operations and data remain protected. In contrast, untrusted systems include elements like the host operating system, the hypervisor outside the trusted execution environment, network infrastructure, storage systems (regardless of encryption at rest), and external services such as DNS or certificate authorities. These components are considered untrusted because they operate outside the hardware-enforced security perimeter and may be susceptible to compromise or manipulation. The architecture is intentionally designed so that, even in the event of a breach or compromise of untrusted systems, the security and confidentiality of trusted components and their data are preserved.

**KMS RPC Services:** ([see service definition in kms_rpc.proto](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/kms/rpc/proto/kms_rpc.proto#L84))

The KMS exposes a comprehensive suite of RPC services designed to facilitate secure cryptographic operations and system integration. One of the core services is application key derivation, which is tightly coupled with remote attestation to ensure that keys are only provisioned to verified and trusted environments. This process leverages attestation evidence to validate the integrity and authenticity of the requesting entity before any key material is derived or released. The KMS also provides robust certificate signing and chain management capabilities, enabling automated issuance, renewal, and revocation of certificates, as well as the maintenance of certificate chains to establish trust hierarchies within the system. For secure handling of sensitive configuration data, the KMS manages environment variable encryption keys, allowing applications to encrypt and decrypt environment variables at runtime without exposing raw secrets. Integration with blockchain technology is another critical service, where the KMS interacts with smart contracts to enforce decentralized authorization policies, ensuring that only entities with valid on-chain permissions can access protected resources or perform sensitive operations. Additionally, the KMS oversees image cache management, which involves the secure storage, retrieval, and validation of container or VM images, ensuring that only attested and authorized images are deployed within the infrastructure.

**Key Types Managed:**  
(see [kms_rpc.proto message struct definition](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/kms/rpc/proto/kms_rpc.proto#L21))

The KMS is responsible for managing a diverse set of cryptographic key types, each tailored to specific security requirements within the platform. It maintains the TLS CA certificate chain, which forms the foundation of trust for all TLS communications by enabling the issuance and validation of server and client certificates. For data-at-rest protection, the KMS generates and stores disk encryption keys that are used to implement full disk encryption, safeguarding sensitive data even if physical storage is compromised. To support secure environment variable handling, the KMS provisions X25519 keys, which are used for encrypting and decrypting environment variables, ensuring that secrets remain protected throughout their lifecycle. The system also manages ECDSA K256 keys, which are essential for performing Ethereum-compatible cryptographic operations, such as signing blockchain transactions or verifying signatures in decentralized applications. Finally, the KMS orchestrates the creation and management of signed key chains, which are used for trust verification across distributed components, enabling secure delegation and validation of cryptographic authority within the ecosystem.

## Guest Agent Architecture

[See main.rs implementation reference](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/guest-agent/src/main.rs#L200)

The Guest Agent runs inside each CVM and provides the runtime environment for applications.

### Guest Agent Internal Architecture

*This diagram depicts the internal architecture of the Guest Agent, which operates inside each confidential VM (CVM) to orchestrate application runtime, container lifecycle, and security services. Core service groupings show how external and internal APIs interact with the state manager, which coordinates both application execution and cryptographic operations. Container management subsystems oversee Docker runtime, monitoring, and system health, while the security layer handles key derivation, attestation, and event logging. The flow of data and control across these modules demonstrates how the Guest Agent maintains both robust runtime orchestration and a strong security posture within the confidential computing environment.*

## Network Architecture

### Multi-Layer Network Security

([gateway config](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/gateway/gateway.toml#L38)) ([vmm config](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/vmm/vmm.toml#L12))

*This diagram provides a detailed view of the dstack multi-layer network architecture, emphasizing the layered security controls that protect communication from the public internet down to confidential workloads. Each layer is visually differentiated by shades of green, representing increasing trust and isolation as traffic flows inward. The structure ensures strict separation between external access, secure tunnels, and internal virtualized resources, while maintaining strong cryptographic guarantees at every boundary. The architecture demonstrates how network segmentation, encrypted tunneling, automated certificate management, and container-level isolation work together to create a robust and defense-in-depth security posture.*

### Network Configuration Layers

* **Public Layer:**
  Handles all ingress from the public internet. HTTPS and DNS traffic are first received and terminated at the load balancer. This layer enforces TLS encryption at the network edge and acts as the first point of defense against external threats.

* **Gateway Layer:**
  Consists of the load balancer, TLS termination, and automated certificate management using ACME. Here, connections are securely routed and encrypted certificates are managed dynamically. The gateway strictly enforces security boundaries and forwards only authenticated, encrypted traffic deeper into the stack.

* **VPN Layer:**
  All internal traffic passes through a dedicated WireGuard VPN overlay. Encrypted tunnels are automatically provisioned for both host-to-host and host-to-VM traffic, providing confidential communication even across untrusted networks. This adds a strong cryptographic layer, ensuring that no data traverses the underlying infrastructure unprotected.

* **CVM Internal Network:**
  At the heart of the system, the internal network segments VM and container workloads via isolated virtual bridges and DHCP-managed subnets. Each confidential VM (CVM) and its containers receive unique, securely allocated addresses, minimizing lateral movement and further compartmentalizing resources. Communication between workloads is strictly controlled and isolated from public and management networks.

* **Security:**
  All network segments are encrypted and authenticated, with certificates managed automatically and VPN keys rotated regularly. Only explicitly authorized endpoints can communicate, and all management, orchestration, and application data flows are cryptographically verified at each boundary.

---

**The layered network architecture implements mandatory isolation between public, management, and confidential computing environments. Each segment is cryptographically protected, with no direct access permitted across boundaries. Only authenticated and authorized traffic is allowed to traverse between layers, minimizing attack surface and enforcing defense-in-depth.**
