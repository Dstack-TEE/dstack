## TEE-Integrated Certbot Architecture

### 1. Hardware-Sealed Private Key Management

The Certbot integration would replace standard key generation with TEE-derived keys using dstack's key derivation framework. Instead of generating keys with `rcgen::KeyPair::generate()`, the system would leverage the existing KDF infrastructure [1](#1-0)  to derive ECDSA key pairs from TEE-sealed master keys.

The key derivation would use measurement-based context data, incorporating TDX RTMR values and app-specific identifiers [2](#1-1)  to ensure keys are bound to the specific TEE environment and application state.

### 2. Attestation-Bound Certificate Generation

Certificates would embed TDX attestation quotes using the RA-TLS framework. The system would generate quotes containing the certificate's public key hash [3](#1-2)  and embed them as X.509 extensions in the certificate, following the existing attestation patterns [4](#1-3) .

The quote generation would use the guest agent's RPC interface [5](#1-4)  to create attestation quotes with the certificate public key as report data, ensuring cryptographic binding between the certificate and the TEE state.

### 3. Enclave-Resident Operations

All certificate operations would be performed within the TEE using the guest agent's key derivation services [6](#1-5) . Private keys would never exist in plaintext outside the TEE, with all signing operations happening within the secure enclave.

The system would utilize the existing TLS key generation service [7](#1-6)  to create attestation-enabled certificates directly within the TEE environment.

### 4. Intel TDX Attestation Integration

The architecture would leverage dstack's TDX attestation primitives [8](#1-7)  to generate quotes that prove the certificate was created within a trusted execution environment. These quotes would include measurements of the entire software stack from firmware through application.

Event log integration would record certificate generation events [9](#1-8)  in RTMR3, providing cryptographic proof of certificate lifecycle events within the attestation chain.

### 5. Measurement-Based Verification

The system would implement verification logic that validates both the certificate chain and the embedded attestation data. This would use the existing attestation verification framework [10](#1-9)  to ensure certificates are only trusted when generated within verified TEE environments.

App information extraction [11](#1-10)  would provide additional context about the certificate's origin, including device ID, instance ID, and measurement values that can be verified against expected baselines.

### 6. Enhanced ACME Protocol Integration

The ACME client would be modified to include attestation proofs in certificate requests, potentially as a new challenge type or as additional metadata. The existing DNS-01 challenge flow would be enhanced to include TEE attestation validation by the Certificate Authority.

Key renewal operations would maintain the TEE binding by deriving new keys from the same master key material while updating the embedded attestation quotes to reflect current TEE state [12](#1-11) .

## Security Guarantees

This architecture would provide:

- **Hardware-backed key security**: Private keys derived from and sealed to TEE measurements
- **Attestation-bound certificates**: Cryptographic proof of certificate origin within verified TEE
- **Measurement-based validation**: End-to-end verification from hardware through application
- **Tamper-evident operations**: Event log records of all certificate lifecycle events
- **Zero-trust verification**: Certificates include all necessary attestation data for independent verification

## Notes

The integration leverages dstack's existing TEE security infrastructure, requiring minimal changes to the core attestation and key derivation systems. The architecture maintains compatibility with standard ACME protocols while adding TEE-specific security enhancements. This design ensures that certificates issued through this system provide cryptographic proof of their generation within trusted execution environments, enabling new use cases for high-assurance SSL/TLS certificates.
