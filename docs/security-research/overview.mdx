description: "Deep technical analysis of dstack's security architecture for researchers and security engineers"
---
This section offers an in-depth security analysis of dstack's TEE implementation. For general information, refer to the [Core Concepts](/docs/concepts/overview) section.

## For Security Researchers

dstack is built on a foundation of hardware-enforced security primitives. This section provides detailed technical analysis of each security-critical component, including:

- **Source code references** with direct links to implementation
- **Cryptographic protocol analysis** and trust boundaries
- **Attestation flow diagrams** and verification procedures
- **Key management architecture** and secure storage mechanisms
