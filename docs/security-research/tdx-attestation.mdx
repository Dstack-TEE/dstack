# TDX Attestation Security Analysis

## Overview

dStack’s TDX attestation system delivers hardware-backed cryptographic proof of execution integrity using Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). At its core, the implementation is powered by the [`tdx-attest` crate](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a/tdx-attest/src/lib.rs), which directly interfaces with Intel TDX hardware to generate strong, unforgeable attestation quotes.

## Architectural Synthesis

dStack’s TDX attestation security architecture is designed as an end-to-end chain of verifiable trust, beginning at the Intel TDX hardware root and extending through every software and policy layer involved in confidential workload execution. Each step of the process—from the first code loaded by the TDX module, to the runtime configuration of guest VMs, and up to the application—contributes cryptographically measured evidence to an immutable trust chain. 

What makes this model robust is its compositional layering: every system stage (firmware, kernel, initrd, application) records its state in hardware-backed measurement registers, and these are captured and sealed in an attestation quote—cryptographically signed by Intel’s hardware-rooted key infrastructure. Validation does not stop at signature checking: event log replay, measurement validation, and report data binding all ensure that not only was the environment authentic at a moment in time, but that its entire boot and runtime sequence is tamper-evident and externally auditable.

By combining TDX’s hardware assurances with policy enforcement through smart contracts and cryptographically controlled key management, dStack provides a closed loop of attestation, authorization, and key provisioning. This architecture makes it possible to deliver both continuous runtime integrity and decentralized, verifiable trust for confidential applications and distributed systems.

## TDX Attestation Security – Enhanced Architecture Diagram & Flow

the following section describes the comprehensive, multi-layered trust and attestation flow in dstack’s TDX security architecture. each component and connection is designed to ensure that every stage of the workload lifecycle—from hardware boot to application execution and key provisioning—is cryptographically measured, auditable, and verifiable.

- **Hardware Root of Trust:** The process begins with Intel TDX hardware, establishing a silicon-anchored root of trust. The TDX Module (SEAM Mode) manages the secure launch and measurement of the firmware and subsequent layers.
- **Boot Chain Integrity:** The OVMF firmware, Linux kernel, initrd, and dStack application are each measured and extended into dedicated RTMRs (Runtime Measurement Registers), ensuring that any modification or tampering is detectable.
- **Measurement Registers:** MRTD and RTMR0–3 capture the state of hardware configuration, kernel, initrd, and application. These measurements are chained and sealed into the attestation quote.
- **Quote Generation & Event Logging:** The TDX Quote Generator collects all RTMR values and report data, producing a signed attestation quote. Simultaneously, a cryptographically secure event log records every measurement extension, supporting full replay and auditability.
- **Quote Verification & KMS Integration:** The quote, along with the event log, is verified against Intel’s CA root keys. The KMS node then authenticates the attestation, interacts with smart contracts for policy enforcement, and manages root/app keys for secure provisioning.
- **Trust Verification & Policy Enforcement:** Additional verification steps—such as image verification, measurement recalculation, and signature chain validation—ensure that only trusted workloads receive cryptographic keys and access.

## Security Architecture

### Hardware Root of Trust

This attestation system takes advantage of Intel TDX CPU instructions to produce TD reports that are fundamentally resistant to forgery, even by malicious hypervisors or privileged host software. All low-level interactions use direct CPU calls, such as [`tdx_att_get_report`](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/tdx-attest/src/linux.rs#L88) and [`tdx_att_get_quote`](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/tdx-attest/src/linux.rs#L52), to ensure trust is anchored in silicon.

### Cryptographic Foundations

Every attestation quote leverages ECDSA signatures generated by Intel-provisioned attestation keys, as implemented in the [`tdx-attest` crate](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a/tdx-attest/src/lib.rs). This ensures that only legitimate TDX hardware is capable of issuing valid quotes. Each quote contains a 1024-byte TDX report—including measurement registers and a 64-byte report data field, which can be used to cryptographically bind application-specific data to the attestation.

### Runtime Measurement Registers (RTMRs)

The TDX security model is built around four Runtime Measurement Registers, each capturing a distinct trust boundary:

- **RTMR0:** Virtual hardware configuration (e.g., CPU count, memory size)
- **RTMR1:** Linux kernel measurement
- **RTMR2:** Kernel command line and initramfs measurements
- **RTMR3:** Application runtime measurements (compose hash, instance ID, etc.)

RTMRs use SHA-384 hashing for extension and state tracking, providing a tamper-evident log, as shown in [linux.rs#L129](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/tdx-attest/src/linux.rs#L129) and explained in the [`tdx-attest` crate](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a/tdx-attest/src/lib.rs).

### Event Log Security

dStack’s attestation system maintains a cryptographically secure event log, recording every RTMR extension ([linux.rs#L105](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/tdx-attest/src/linux.rs#L105)). Each event contains the measurement register index, event type, descriptive metadata, and payload. The replay logic ([attestation.rs#L421](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/ra-tls/src/attestation.rs#L421)) enables auditors to verify that RTMR values are consistent with all prior measurements, providing full transparency for the system’s integrity chain.

## Quote Generation and Verification

### Quote Structure and Content

Each TDX quote includes the raw TD report, an attestation key ID, and an ECDSA signature. The guest agent generates quotes securely, padding user data to exactly 64 bytes and invoking TDX hardware attestation APIs—see the logic in [rpc_service.rs#L150](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/guest-agent/src/rpc_service.rs#L150).

### Report Data Binding

Applications can bind arbitrary data to their attestation by filling the 64-byte report data field. The system supports a wide range of cryptographic hash algorithms—including SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, and Keccak—as described in [attestation.rs#L32](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/ra-tls/src/attestation.rs#L32). The implementation enforces length and content validation to ensure strict adherence to TDX’s data-binding requirements.

### Certificate Integration

RA-TLS integrates TDX quotes directly into X.509 certificates as custom extensions, allowing remote attestation as part of the TLS handshake. Verifiers extract and validate embedded quotes with the [`from_cert`](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/ra-tls/src/attestation.rs#L260) method. This provides seamless validation of both the certificate chain and the underlying TEE attestation, ensuring a cryptographically linked trust chain from the hardware root all the way to the TLS endpoint.

## Verification Security Model

### Quote Verification Process

Quotes are verified with the [`verify_with_ra_pubkey`](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/ra-tls/src/attestation.rs#L291) function, which checks the ECDSA signature in the TDX quote against Intel’s public key infrastructure and the RA-TLS public key. It also performs TCB (Trusted Computing Base) checks, and replays the event log to confirm RTMR values reflect the real sequence of system measurements. This robust process ensures attestation is both cryptographically bound to the TLS certificate and accurately describes the enclave’s state.

### TCB Validation

Strict TCB validation is enforced, with the system rejecting debug-enabled TDs and confirming that key measurement registers (`mr_signer_seam`, `mr_service_td`, etc.) match expected values. This is handled in the [`validate_tcb`](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/ra-tls/src/attestation.rs#L346) function, which inspects the TD report for debug attributes and validates critical fields. For SGX enclaves, it also ensures debug attributes are not set. This protects production deployments by refusing to attest development or potentially compromised environments.

### Measurement Chain Validation

dStack reconstructs and verifies the entire measurement chain, from the Measurement Root of Trust for Data (MRTD) through all RTMRs and application identifiers. The [`decode_app_info`](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/ra-tls/src/attestation.rs#L156) function replays the event log and extracts key fields from the TDX report, computing digests like `mr_system` (hashing `mr_td`, RTMR0-2, and the key provider measurement) and `mr_aggregated` (covering all RTMRs and additional fields). This process ensures every element of the trust chain—from firmware and kernel to application identity—is independently validated.

## Integration Security

### Guest Agent Security

The guest agent provides attestation and key management services over authenticated RPC endpoints ([rpc_service.rs#L150](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/guest-agent/src/rpc_service.rs#L150)). These services cover secure ECDSA key derivation, certificate signing, and TDX quote generation. The `get_tls_key` method generates a random seed, derives a unique ECDSA key pair, and requests a signed certificate chain, while `get_quote` pads user data and requests a hardware-backed quote and event log. All requests are carefully validated, and the agent ensures strict separation between application contexts—preventing any cross-tenant key or attestation leakage.

### KMS Integration

The Key Management Service (KMS) uses TDX attestation to securely provision keys, following a chain-of-trust model where application keys are derived only from hardware-attested root keys. Before releasing any cryptographic material, the KMS rigorously verifies TDX quotes.

## Threat Model and Security Guarantees

### What the System Protects Against

dStack’s attestation system, as described in the [dstack attestation design doc](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a/attestation.md), is built to defend against powerful adversaries, including malicious hypervisors and privileged hosts. Hardware-enforced measurements, RTMR monitoring, and strict TCB validation ensure that runtime or rollback attacks are detected. Nonce-based binding in attestation exchanges counters man-in-the-middle attacks by guaranteeing freshness and cryptographic linkage between verifier challenges and enclave attestations.

### Verification Requirements

End-to-end security requires verifying the dStack source code, building enclave images from source, and calculating expected measurement values as explained in [attestation.md §2.2: determining expected MRs](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a/attestation.md#22-determining-expected-mrs). Once calculated, these measurements must match the values in the quote, and the event log must be replayed to confirm the accuracy of RTMR3 and the entire trust chain.

### Trust Boundaries

dStack clearly defines all trust boundaries, starting with Intel TDX hardware as the immutable root of trust. Measurements flow through each stage—virtual firmware, Linux kernel, initramfs, and user applications—and each layer is independently validated. For more detail on how TDX quote measurements correspond to these boundaries, see [attestation.md §2.1: understanding tdx quote measurements](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a/attestation.md#21-understanding-tdx-quote-measurements).

## Cryptographic Implementation Details

### Hash Algorithm Support

The attestation layer supports a full range of cryptographic hash algorithms for report data binding, as implemented in [`attestation.rs#L33`](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/ra-tls/src/attestation.rs#L33). By default, `sha512` is used, but options include `sha256`, `sha384`, all SHA-3 variants, Keccak, and a `raw` mode for direct data binding. Every report data input is prefixed with a content tag (e.g., `kms-root-ca`, `ratls-cert`, `app-data`), ensuring context-specific and unambiguous measurements. This allows applications to select the most suitable hash algorithm, while maintaining interoperability and high security.

### Key Derivation Security

All application keys are deterministically derived from hardware-sealed root keys, using application-specific identifiers for cryptographic isolation between tenants. The guest agent’s [`get_key`](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/guest-agent/src/rpc_service.rs#L150C1-L239C2) RPC method implements this: a root ECDSA key derives per-application keys by path, then signs the derived public key and usage context. This signature chain allows independent verification that every derived key is both valid and bound to the right application, so that only trusted code can use it.

## Error Handling and Security

The TDX attestation implementation features robust, granular error handling with a dedicated `TdxAttestError` enum ([source](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/tdx-attest/src/linux.rs#L20C1-L50C2)). Every failure mode—unexpected errors, invalid parameters, resource exhaustion, hardware failures, and more—has a unique error code and message. This enables both secure operation and straightforward debugging, as each error can be quickly identified and acted upon.

## Simulator Mode Security

For development and testing, dStack provides a simulator mode that emulates the production attestation API using pre-generated quotes and event logs. The simulation logic is in [`simulate_quote`](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/guest-agent/src/rpc_service.rs#L241), which loads simulated artifacts and substitutes the report data field with caller input. Simulator mode is strictly disabled in production builds, ensuring only genuine, hardware-backed attestation is accepted in secure environments.

## Security Monitoring and Auditability

Every runtime measurement is persistently logged, with each event cryptographically bound to its RTMR extension ([`log_rtmr_event`](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/tdx-attest/src/linux.rs#L105)). Events are serialized as JSON and stored in a secure log directory, allowing full post-hoc verification. Auditors can replay and validate the entire execution history, verifying every measurement and trust boundary that dStack enforces.

## Notes

dStack’s TDX attestation provides enterprise-grade security through hardware-rooted trust, complete measurement chains, and rigorous verification at every level. The platform’s guarantees rest on Intel TDX hardware, robust cryptographic construction, and careful, modular validation of all trust boundaries. This design enables flexible deployment for a range of use cases—while ensuring uncompromising security properties wherever it’s used.
