## Blockchain Integration

Blockchain integration is a defining feature of dStack KMS, enabling decentralized, transparent, and tamper-evident authorization for key management. By leveraging Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, dStack KMS enforces application-specific access controls, device restrictions, and upgrade policies directly on-chain. This approach provides a level of auditability and policy assurance that is unmatched by traditional KMS solutions.

### Decentralized Authorization

dStack KMS integrates with Ethereum-compatible blockchains for decentralized authorization. The [AppAuth contract](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/kms/auth-eth/contracts/AppAuth.sol#L9) enforces application-specific access controls—validating allowed compose hashes, device restrictions, and upgrade policies. The KmsAuth contract maintains registries for allowed KMS instances, OS images, and configurations, supporting transparent, auditable policy enforcement.

Authorization logic is enforced directly in the smart contract ([AppAuth.sol#L110](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/kms/auth-eth/contracts/AppAuth.sol#L110)): application identity, compose hash, and device restrictions are all checked on-chain before key access is permitted. Owners can permanently disable upgrades for greater assurance.

### Attestation Verification Pipeline

Key provisioning is controlled by a strict attestation pipeline ([main_service.rs#L407](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/kms/src/main_service.rs#L407)), which verifies:

* TDX quote signature and measurement extraction
* Validation of all runtime measurements (MRTD, RTMR0–RTMR3), application metadata, and device IDs
* Integrity and authenticity of the VM configuration and OS image hash
* Aggregation of all attestation and config data into a `boot_info` structure
* Blockchain authorization via Auth smart contract
* Immediate denial and abort if any requirement fails

> Blockchain integration in dStack KMS is not just a feature—it's a foundation for decentralized, transparent, and policy-driven security. The next section explores the security architecture that underpins these guarantees.
