## Security Architecture

The security architecture of dStack KMS is built on a foundation of hardware-backed key derivation and a rigorous trust model. Every key is produced using HKDF-SHA256, seeded by unique hardware attestation data and domain-separating context. This ensures that each key is cryptographically unique, isolated, and never persisted outside the TEE.

### Hardware-Backed Key Derivation

At the core of dStack KMS is a hardware-rooted key derivation model. Each key is produced via **HKDF-SHA256**, seeded by unique hardware attestation data—specifically, TDX measurements and a domain-separating salt ("RATLS") plus context data (such as application identifiers). See the key derivation implementation in [ra-tls/src/kdf.rs#L19](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/ra-tls/src/kdf.rs#L19).

Key derivation is hierarchical: parent keys can deterministically derive child keys for distinct application, instance, or usage contexts ([ra-tls/src/kdf.rs#L34](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/ra-tls/src/kdf.rs#L34)). This ensures every derived key is cryptographically unique and isolated—even if the same KMS instance manages thousands of workloads, each application's secrets remain independently protected.

### Trust Model

dStack KMS's security model is grounded in four main principles:

1. **Hardware Root of Trust**: All keys are derived from CPU and runtime measurements ([MRTD, RTMR0–RTMR3](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/ra-tls/src/attestation.rs#L393)).
2. **No Key Persistence**: Keys are regenerated as needed from attestation data and are never stored outside TEE memory.
3. **Attestation Gated Access**: Only workloads that have passed strict TDX quote and event log validation ([ra-tls/src/attestation.rs#L291](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/45ebd05a25ad4ffacce3b8f003e4f5a8b609b2e2/ra-tls/src/attestation.rs#L291)) can access keys.
4. **Determinism**: The same measurements and context will always yield the same derived key—supporting reproducibility and scalable, stateless key management.
