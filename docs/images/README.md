# Documentation Images

This directory contains images used in the dstack documentation.

## Placeholder Images

The following placeholder images are referenced in the documentation:

- `ecosystem-architecture.png` - dstack ecosystem architecture diagram
- `dashboard-architecture.png` - Web dashboard architecture overview
- `dstack-architecture-detailed.png` - Detailed platform architecture

These are placeholder references. In a production documentation setup, these would be replaced with actual architectural diagrams, screenshots, and technical illustrations.

## Adding Real Images

To add real images:

1. Create or obtain the appropriate diagrams/screenshots
2. Save them in this directory with the exact filenames referenced in the docs
3. Ensure images are optimized for web (compressed, appropriate resolution)
4. Use descriptive alt text in the documentation for accessibility

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: PNG for diagrams, JPG for photos
- **Resolution**: Maximum 2048px width
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB where possible
- **Naming**: Use lowercase with hyphens, descriptive names
