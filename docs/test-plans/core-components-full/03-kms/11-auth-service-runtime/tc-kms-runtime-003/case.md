# TC-KMS-RUNTIME-003: Authorization deployment and management scripts

## Metadata

- Priority: P0
- Type: Functional, Security, Regression
- Minimum environment: INTEGRATION
- Automation: Yes
- Requirements: [req-kms-runtime-003](../../../feature-audit.md#req-kms-runtime-003)
- Risks: [risk-kms-runtime-003](../../../feature-audit.md#risk-kms-runtime-003)
- Source: `dstack/kms/auth-eth/script`

## Prepared execution knowledge

- Read and obey [`automation/execution-guide.md`](../../../automation/execution-guide.md) before executing Step 1.
- Read `DSTACK_TEST_RUNTIME_MANIFEST` once and use its prepared binaries, shared Cargo target, fixture paths, commit, and toolchain as authoritative. Do not rediscover them from processes, old sessions, or broad source searches.
- Runtime state and evidence remain case-scoped even though immutable build outputs are shared.
- Use the case metadata, inventories, and prepared manifest as the complete initial execution specification. Source inspection before the first tested operation is allowed only for a specific unresolved ambiguity.
- Do not run a clean build unless this case explicitly tests build, packaging, features, or reproducibility. Otherwise reuse the shared target and prepared binaries.
- If a mismatch occurs, write the provisional result first. Perform narrow source-level root-cause analysis only when failure investigation is enabled.

## Objective

Verify authorization deployment and management scripts for documented success, boundary, failure, concurrency, and recovery behavior.

## Preconditions

1. Prepare isolated run-scoped inputs and capture effective configuration, service state, files, mounts, processes, network endpoints, and public status.
2. Use sentinel credentials only; evidence records hashes/presence and never the secret value.

## Test Data

Include valid values, empty/minimum/maximum values, malformed input, duplicate invocation, a dependency outage, and an adjacent app or node identity.

## Steps

<a id="tc-kms-runtime-003-step-01"></a>
### Step 1: Exercise the complete behavior matrix

Run deploy/manage/query/upgrade scripts on clean and existing deployments with missing/wrong env, wrong chain, unauthorized signer and dry-run checks.

**Expected results:**

- Scripts target the recorded chain/contracts, validate signer/state/storage layout, are idempotent where documented and cannot partially mutate on preflight failure.

### Step 2: Verify failure atomicity and recovery

Interrupt each external dependency before and after its commit point, issue a duplicate/concurrent request, restore the dependency, and retry.

**Expected results:**

- Uncertain input fails closed, no partial trusted output is consumed, resources are released, retry converges once, and diagnostics identify the exact phase without secrets.

### Step 3: Verify persistence, isolation, and cleanup

Restart the owning service or VM where permitted, re-query all affected state, test the adjacent identity, and perform documented cleanup.

**Expected results:**

- Persistent/transient state follows policy, the adjacent identity is unchanged, no credential is exposed, and files, mounts, devices, processes, listeners, and counters return to baseline.

## Postconditions

Remove run-scoped inputs and faults; preserve redacted native outputs and required attachments.
