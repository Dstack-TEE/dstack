# Welcome to dstack

<page_summary>
dstack is an open-source platform that abstracts the complexity of deploying containerized applications to Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). By providing a developer-friendly interface atop hardware security primitives, dstack enables organizations to leverage confidential computing without requiring deep expertise in TEE-specific implementations. This documentation serves as the authoritative guide for understanding, installing, and operating dstack in production environments.

<smoothly_flowing_prose_paragraphs>
In the contemporary landscape of cloud computing, the tension between computational utility and data confidentiality presents a fundamental challenge. Traditional deployment models require implicit trust in infrastructure providers, creating vulnerabilities that are increasingly untenable for sensitive workloads. dstack emerges as a solution to this dilemma, bridging the gap between the ease of container orchestration and the security guarantees of hardware-based isolation.

At its core, dstack transforms the deployment of secure applications from a specialized cryptographic exercise into a routine operational task. By abstracting the complexities of Trusted Execution Environments behind familiar interfaces—Docker, REST APIs, and web dashboards—the platform democratizes access to confidential computing technologies that were previously the domain of security specialists.

## Theoretical Foundations

<smoothly_flowing_prose_paragraphs>
The security guarantees provided by dstack rest upon hardware primitives implemented in modern processors. Intel's Trust Domain Extensions (TDX), the primary supported platform, creates cryptographically isolated execution environments through a combination of memory encryption, integrity protection, and remote attestation capabilities. These hardware features, while powerful, traditionally require extensive expertise to utilize effectively.

dstack's innovation lies not in the creation of new security primitives, but in their thoughtful composition and abstraction. By treating the Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) as the fundamental unit of deployment—analogous to containers in traditional orchestration—the platform enables a familiar operational model while preserving the security properties of the underlying hardware.

## Production Deployment Patterns

<Highlight>
Organizations typically progress through three stages of dstack adoption: experimental validation, pilot deployment, and production integration. Each stage builds upon the previous, allowing incremental trust establishment and operational familiarity.
