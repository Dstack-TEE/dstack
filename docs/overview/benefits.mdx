# Security Benefits


### 1. Hardware-Enforced Data Protection

dstack uses hardware security primitives to eliminate vulnerabilities found in traditional software-based security. This means:

<ul className="my-6 space-y-3">
  <li>
    <strong>Zero Trust by Default:</strong> always verify—never assume trust.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Insider Threats Neutralized:</strong> privilege escalation and insider attacks are blocked at the hardware level.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Security with Certainty:</strong> enforced by physical properties, not just policies.
  </li>
</ul>

### 2. Verifiable Compliance

dstack transforms compliance into a seamless, provable state. Continuous cryptographic attestation ensures regulatory adherence, slashing audit costs and accelerating certifications.

## Strategic Benefits

dstack is an open‑source runtime that encapsulates hardware Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) inside portable, cryptographically attestable containers, converting what was once a costly, fragile specialty into a routine build target for modern crypto, AI, and IoT workloads. Its integrated zero‑trust key‑management service and hardened virtual‑machine monitor let any Docker‑Compose stack launch as a verifiable enclave—on public clouds, bare metal, or even under smart‑contract control—so blockchains and conventional systems alike can perform confidential, high‑value computation without disclosing data or code. Each workload emits a tamper‑evident proof‑of‑execution chain that compresses security assessments from weeks to minutes, accelerates deal closure, and supports premium pricing. Automatic TEE‑feature detection and policy templates keep deployments aligned with fast‑moving silicon roadmaps and regulatory baselines.

## Operational Benefits

### 3. Accelerated Time-to-Security

dstack enables organizations to achieve robust, production-ready security within minutes, without requiring any code changes—simply deploy as you would a standard Docker container.

### Economic Impact

Adopting dstack reshapes the total cost of ownership for secure computing. Standard DevOps teams can operate enclaves with familiar Docker tooling, eliminating the premium for scarce TEE specialists. Out‑of‑the‑box compliance artefact generation streamlines audits and slashes consultancy costs. Unified runtime and policy layers reduce integration effort, while deterministic, usage‑based attestation curbs capex otherwise sunk into over‑provisioned dedicated hardware. These efficiencies deliver substantial direct and indirect savings, enabling organisations to deploy verifiable security controls at cloud scale without the prohibitive overheads typical of bespoke hardware‑security solutions.

### 4. Operational Simplicity

dstack makes secure computing easy to use with the tools and workflows your team already knows—no extra training needed.

# Environmental & Social Benefits
In today’s environment, the pace of AI and digital transformation is outstripping the ability of regulations—and even internal teams—to keep up. The real challenge isn’t just about fending off outside threats; it’s about protecting your own hardware, your employees, and even your customers from risks that can emerge inside and outside your organization. As systems become more complex and interconnected, it’s increasingly difficult for businesses to know how to add immediate, tangible value to their networks without introducing new vulnerabilities or bottlenecks. The shortage of specialized security talent only makes this harder, leaving many teams unsure how to move fast without compromising safety. Fortunately, the dstack Framework is open source and available to everyone, making it possible for any organization to leverage advanced confidential computing—no matter their size or expertise.
