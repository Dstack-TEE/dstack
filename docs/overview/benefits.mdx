# Launch a Confidential Cloud—fast

dstack turns any Docker‑Compose stack into a hardware‑sealed, cryptographically attested enclave that runs on public clouds, bare metal, or under smart‑contract control. The result: stronger security, smoother audits, and room to innovate—all with the tools you already use.

## Operational Upside

- **Zero‑change deployment:** ship the containers you have; dstack adds the enclave layer at runtime.
- **Self‑healing scale:** auto‑repairs and auto‑scales without leaking state.
- **Leak‑free observability:** real‑time metrics and logs stay inside the TEE boundary.
- **Click‑to‑manage UI:** pause, resume, or revoke workloads without touching the CLI.

## Security & Compliance at the Core

- **Hardware‑enforced isolation** blocks kernel, hypervisor, and insider attacks.
- **Cryptographic attestation** proves code, config, and firmware on every boot.
- **Always‑on encryption** protects data in use, at rest, and in transit.
- **One‑click compliance** surfaces SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA evidence instantly.

## Meta

**Use SDKs in any language**—connect your app to secure enclaves without changing your code.

**All internal traffic is encrypted and authenticated**—your cloud apps are protected by default.

**Enclaves auto-scale and self-heal**—your services stay online, even if something fails.

**See real-time metrics and logs**—debug easily, but sensitive data never leaks.

**Encryption and security checks run at hardware speed**—big data and AI stay fast.

**Every admin action and key event is logged and tamper-proof**—compliance and audits are simple.

**Compliance checks and reports are automated**—meet standards like GDPR or SOC 2 with no extra work.

**Only verified containers go to production enclaves**—supply-chain attacks are blocked before they start.

## A new way to take control over your programs

- **On‑chain key custody** replaces central vaults with distributed trust.
- **Supply‑chain shield** blocks unverified images before prod.
- **Faster deal cycles:** attested proofs turn weeks of security reviews into minutes.
- **Premium services:** monetize confidential AI, finance, or healthcare workloads without exposing IP or data.

> **Bottom line:** dstack delivers secure, scalable, and compliant cloud deployments—no rewrites, no slowdowns.
