> This glossary defines key dstack terms—what they mean, why they matter, and how they're used—organised A-Z with **bold terms**, *italic highlights*, and helpful links.

---

## A – C

### **ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment)**
Open IETF protocol ([RFC 8555](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555)) that lets software request, renew, and revoke TLS certificates without human intervention.  
*In dstack*: **dstack-gateway** calls *Certbot* in the DNS-01 flow so you can obtain a valid certificate even when ports 80/443 are fire-walled, guaranteeing "zero-touch" HTTPS for every app.

### **ACME DNS-01 Challenge**
Flow in which domain control is proven by publishing a TXT record under `_acme-challenge.<domain>`.  
*In dstack*: used at first boot; the gateway automation injects the TXT record via your DNS provider's API, then cleans it up after issuance.

### **App-id**
Unique identifier for deployed applications in dstack, typically derived from the application's cryptographic hash.  
*In dstack*: used for routing (`<app-id>.domain.com`), key derivation, and authorization checks with smart contracts.

### **AppAuth**
Ethereum smart-contract that stores the *allowed container-image hash* for a given application and signals the gateway that a CVM may expose traffic once its **Attestation Quote** matches that hash.  
*In dstack*: every new deployment registers its image digest with AppAuth; the gateway consults this contract before adding a route.  
Further reading: [Smart-contract basics](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) • [dstack component map (GitHub)](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack#architecture).

### **Attestation Quote**
Signed report produced by a TEE (e.g. Intel TDX) that hashes each boot component (`RTMR0-3`) and binds them to a verifier-supplied nonce.  
*In dstack*: **dstack-guest-agent** forwards the quote to **dstack-kms**; keys flow only when the measurements match the on-chain allow-list.

### **Blockchain & Smart Contracts**
Deterministic programs (e.g. **KmsAuth**, **AppAuth**) stored on a public chain. They record trusted hashes and decide whether a node, image, or user may receive keys.  
*In dstack*: provide decentralised governance and an immutable audit trail—removing single points of failure typical in classical PKI.

### **CAA Records (Certification Authority Authorization)**
DNS records that specify which certificate authorities are allowed to issue certificates for a domain.  
*In dstack*: automatically managed by the gateway to restrict certificate issuance and prevent unauthorized certificates.

### **Certificate Transparency (CT)**
Public log system ([RFC 6962](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6962)) for every certificate issued by participating CAs.  
*In dstack*: the gateway subscribes to CT feeds and automatically revokes or alerts on rogue certs for your domains.

### **Certbot**
EFF-maintained ACME client that automates Let's Encrypt operations.  
*In dstack*: shipped inside the gateway image; runs on a timer to renew certs ~30 days before expiry without downtime.

### **CID (Container ID)**
Unique identifier for QEMU virtual machines in dstack, managed by the VMM's allocation pool.  
*In dstack*: prevents conflicts between VMs; configured via `cid_start` and `cid_pool_size` in VMM settings.

### **Compose-hash**
Cryptographic hash of the `docker-compose.yml` file content used for application verification.  
*In dstack*: measured into RTMR registers and validated against blockchain records for secure deployments.

### **Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM)**
VM backed by a hardware TEE (Intel TDX today) providing automatic memory encryption and verifiable launch measurements.  
*In dstack*: every user workload lives in a CVM so that the cloud operator, host OS, and hypervisor cannot read or tamper with data in use.

### **Container Runtime**
Minimal OCI runtime (*runc* / *crun*) inside the CVM image.  
*In dstack*: obtains secrets through the guest-agent's Unix socket rather than env-vars, reducing the attack surface for in-container code.

## D – F

### **DCAP (Data-Center Attestation Primitives)**
Intel open-source libraries for local verification of SGX / TDX quotes.  
*In dstack*: bundled with KMS to avoid external Intel Attestation Service dependencies.  
[GitHub](https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives)

### **Device-id**
Hardware-specific identifier used in attestation and authorization processes.  
*In dstack*: helps ensure deployments run only on authorized hardware and prevents unauthorized migration.

### **DNS TXT Record Lookup**
Method for service discovery using DNS text records with the `_dstack-app-address` prefix.  
*In dstack*: enables custom domain routing by publishing application endpoints in DNS records.

### **Docker Compose**
YAML file describing a multi-container app.  
*In dstack*: your unchanged Compose file is parsed by the VMM; each service is mapped to a secure network endpoint.

### **dstack CLI**
Command-line interface for deploying and managing applications in dstack.  
*In dstack*: primary user interface for `deploy`, `list`, `stop` operations and application lifecycle management.

### **dstack-gateway**
Security-aware reverse proxy: performs WireGuard ingress, RA-TLS validation, automatic certificate management, and CT monitoring.  
*Role*: single public entry-point for all CVMs.

### **dstack-guest-agent**
Small Rust daemon inside every CVM. Exposes RPC for `get_quote`, `get_key`, and `start_container`.  
*Role*: sole entity allowed to unseal keys, ensuring secrets never leave the encrypted memory domain.

### **dstack-kms (Key Management Service)**
CVM-resident service that uses **DCAP** to verify quotes, then deterministically derives per-app keys (disk, TLS, JWT) from a master seed.  
*Role*: dstack's root of cryptographic trust.

### **dstack-os**
Minimal, security-hardened Linux image (~40 MiB) built by **meta-dstack**, stripping out shells, compilers, and package managers to shrink the attack surface.  
*Benefit*: identical runtime across TEE hardware and faster boot times.  
Further reading: [Phala blog](https://phala.network/posts/Dstack-A-Zero-Trust-Framework-for-Confidential-Containers) • [meta-dstack layer](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/main/meta-dstack).

### **dstack-util**
Comprehensive command-line utility providing TDX attestation, system initialization, cryptographic services, and container management.  
*In dstack*: handles full disk encryption setup, RTMR extensions, certificate generation, and system bootstrapping within CVMs.

### **dstack-vmm (Virtual Machine Manager)**
Rust supervisor on the host that spawns, monitors, and tears down CVMs via QEMU + TDX, and presents a REST/GUI that accepts your `docker-compose.yaml`.  
*Role*: bridges DevOps tooling to hardware TEE features.

### **FDE (Full-Disk Encryption)**
Block-level encryption via Linux *dm-crypt/LUKS*.  
*In dstack*: `dstack-util setup` seals the volume key so disks remain unreadable until the CVM passes attestation.

SHA-384 hash stored in TDX Runtime Measurement Registers.  
*In dstack*: compared against the allow-list in **KmsAuth** before keys are released.

### **KmsAuth**
Smart-contract that keeps an *allow-list of trusted RTMR hashes* and authorises **dstack-kms** to release keys only when a presented quote matches one of those hashes.  
*In dstack*: policy gate for every key-release request.  
Further reading: [Ethereum smart-contract docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) • [dstack README](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack#readme).

*In dstack*: initialises NVMe drives attached to CVMs using AES-XTS-Plain64 cipher.

### **meta-dstack**
Yocto meta-layer that builds the dstack-os image with only the guest-agent, container runtime, and attestation libs.  
*Benefit*: smaller footprint and reproducible builds.

### **MRTD (Measurement of Runtime TDX Data)**
CPU register that records a SHA-384 hash of the *static* TD state (e.g. firmware) at build time—complements dynamic `RTMR0-3`.  
*In dstack*: **dstack-kms** and **KmsAuth** validate MRTD inside each quote.

### **RA-TLS (Remote-Attestation TLS)**
Technique ([arXiv 1801.05863](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05863.pdf)) of embedding a quote in an X.509 extension so the TLS handshake authenticates enclave state.  
*In dstack*: the gateway proxies traffic only after validating this extension.

### **ra-rpc**
Wrapper around pRPC that tunnels every request through RA-TLS, giving internal API calls the same attestation guarantees as HTTPS.  
*In dstack*: used by control-plane traffic (VMM ↔ KMS ↔ Guest Agent).

### **Remote Attestation**
Two-party protocol where a quote is generated and verified (using DCAP certs & CRLs).  
*In dstack*: prerequisite for key release, network exposure, and service registration.

### **Resource Allocation**
Policy-driven distribution of CPU, RAM, and network to CVMs—enforced by cgroups and tc filters.  
*Goal*: prevent noisy-neighbour issues while upholding TEE guarantees.

### **RPC API**
VMM endpoint (`/prpc`) for VM lifecycle management and operations using Protocol Buffers.

### **tdx-attest**
Rust crate that talks to the TDX module to fetch quotes, extend RTMRs, and bundle them into RA-TLS certificates.  
*In dstack*: compiled into the guest-agent so every CVM can self-serve attestation material.  
GitHub: [tdx-attestation-sdk](https://github.com/automata-network/tdx-attestation-sdk)

### **TLS Passthrough**
Gateway routing mode where TLS termination is handled by the application rather than the gateway.  
*In dstack*: enabled by appending 's' to domain names (`<app-id>s.domain.com`) for end-to-end encryption.

### **TLS Termination**
Gateway mode where HTTPS connections are decrypted at the gateway and forwarded as HTTP to applications.  
*In dstack*: default mode for `<app-id>.domain.com` routing with automatic certificate management.

### **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**
Hardware-enforced enclave yielding confidentiality and integrity even against a malicious OS.  
*In dstack*: foundational primitive—everything else is orchestration.  
See [GlobalPlatform TEE architecture](https://globalplatform.org/specs-library/tee-systems-architecture/).

### **Web UI**
