# Key Features

<page_summary>
This document provides a comprehensive examination of dstack's key features, analyzing how each capability contributes to the platform's mission of democratizing confidential computing. Beyond simple feature enumeration, we explore the technical implementation details, architectural decisions, and real-world implications of each capability. The features are presented in a hierarchical structure that reflects their interdependencies and collective contribution to the platform's security posture.
</page_summary>

<smoothly_flowing_prose_paragraphs>
The feature set of a confidential computing platform must balance seemingly contradictory requirements: providing robust security guarantees while maintaining operational simplicity, enabling hardware-level isolation while supporting flexible deployment patterns, and enforcing cryptographic verification while preserving performance. dstack's features represent careful engineering decisions that navigate these tensions, creating a cohesive platform that serves both security requirements and developer productivity.

Each feature in dstack builds upon foundational security primitives provided by hardware TEEs, extending them with practical capabilities required for production deployments. The platform's innovation lies not in individual features but in their integration—creating emergent properties that exceed the sum of their parts.
</smoothly_flowing_prose_paragraphs>

## Core Security Features

### 1. Hardware-Enforced Isolation

<Note>
Hardware isolation forms the bedrock of dstack's security model, providing guarantees that cannot be circumvented by software attacks.
</Note>

<smoothly_flowing_prose_paragraphs>
Traditional virtualization provides logical isolation between workloads, but privileged software (hypervisors, host OS) retains the ability to access guest memory. dstack leverages processor extensions that encrypt memory at the hardware level, making it cryptographically impossible for even privileged software to access protected data.
</smoothly_flowing_prose_paragraphs>

#### Technical Implementation

```rust
// Simplified representation of hardware isolation enforcement
pub struct IsolatedExecution {
    // Hardware-encrypted memory region
    encrypted_memory: EncryptedMemoryRegion,
    // Processor-managed encryption keys
    memory_encryption_key: HardwareKey,
    // Attestation measurements
    measurements: TrustedMeasurements,
}

impl IsolatedExecution {
    pub fn execute<T>(&self, computation: impl Fn() -> T) -> SecureResult<T> {
        // 1. Switch to encrypted memory context
        self.enter_secure_context()?;
        
        // 2. Execute computation with hardware protection
        let result = self.with_memory_encryption(|| {
            computation()
        });
        
        // 3. Generate attestation of execution
        let attestation = self.generate_attestation(&result)?;
        
        Ok(SecureResult { result, attestation })
    }
}
```

#### Security Guarantees

| Property | Guarantee | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Memory Confidentiality | AES-256 encryption | Hardware memory controller |
| Access Control | Cryptographic isolation | CPU access checks |
| Side-Channel Resistance | Reduced attack surface | Hardware mitigations |
| Physical Attack Protection | Memory bus encryption | On-die encryption engine |

### 2. Remote Attestation

<smoothly_flowing_prose_paragraphs>
Remote attestation provides cryptographic proof of the execution environment's state, enabling external parties to verify that applications run in genuine TEEs with expected configurations. dstack extends basic attestation with a comprehensive verification framework that simplifies integration while maintaining security properties.
</smoothly_flowing_prose_paragraphs>

#### Attestation Architecture

# Standard docker-compose.yml works without changes
version: '3.8'
services:
  webapp:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html

# dstack automatically adds security layers:

## Platform Management Features

### 4. Decentralized Key Management

<smoothly_flowing_prose_paragraphs>
Cryptographic key management represents one of the most challenging aspects of secure systems. dstack's decentralized approach eliminates single points of failure while providing practical key lifecycle management. The integration with blockchain technology ensures that key operations are auditable and governed by consensus rather than central authority.
</smoothly_flowing_prose_paragraphs>

#### Key Management Architecture

```rust
// Decentralized key management implementation
pub struct DecentralizedKMS {
    // Local secure key storage
    local_keystore: SecureKeystore,
    // Blockchain integration
    blockchain: BlockchainClient,
    // Threshold cryptography
    threshold_scheme: ThresholdCrypto,
}

impl DecentralizedKMS {
    pub async fn provision_key(&self, policy: KeyPolicy) -> Result<KeyHandle> {
        // 1. Generate key shares using threshold cryptography
        let shares = self.threshold_scheme.generate_shares(
            policy.threshold,
            policy.total_shares
        )?;
        
        // 2. Distribute shares to TEE nodes
        let distribution = self.distribute_shares(shares).await?;
        
        // 3. Register on blockchain
        let tx = self.blockchain.register_key(KeyRegistration {
            policy: policy.clone(),
            distribution_proof: distribution.proof(),
            attestation: self.generate_attestation()?,
        }).await?;
        
        Ok(KeyHandle::new(tx.key_id))
    }
}
```
