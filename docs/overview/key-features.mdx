dstack lets you push the same containers you run today into CPU-encrypted enclaves, so code and data stay private while hardware-level crypto keeps performance high. 
Every deployment is attested for integrity, keys live in a shared on-chain vault, TLS certs renew themselves, and all traffic stays encrypted end to end. 

A point-and-click dashboard replaces CLI wrangling, language-agnostic SDKs plug into any stack, and the platform auto-scales, heals, and logs without leaking sensitive info. 
You get an immutable audit trail, one-click compliance reports, 

and a supply-chain filter that blocks unverified images—secure infrastructure without the rewrite.
## Supporting Features

**Use SDKs in any major language** to connect your app to secure enclaves—no need to rewrite code. Great for teams deploying multi-language microservices in the cloud. *Understand the term*: SDKs (Software Development Kits) are tools that help your app interact with secure enclaves easily.

**All internal traffic is encrypted and authenticated by default**, so your cloud workloads stay protected from lateral threats. *Understand the term*: Encryption ensures data privacy, while authentication verifies the identity of communicating parties.

**Enclaves auto-scale and self-heal**, keeping your cloud services online and responsive even during failures or demand spikes. *Understand the term*: Auto-scaling adjusts resources as needed, and self-healing means automatic recovery from failures.

**Get real-time metrics and logs for debugging**, but never leak sensitive data—ideal for regulated cloud environments. *Understand the term*: Real-time metrics and logs provide immediate insight into system health and issues, without exposing confidential information.

**Encryption and security checks run at hardware speed**, so even big data or AI workloads in the cloud don’t slow down. *Understand the term*: Hardware-level security means cryptographic operations are fast and efficient.

**Every admin action and key event is logged and tamper-proof**, making compliance and incident response easy for cloud deployments. *Understand the term*: Tamper-proof logs ensure that records of actions and events cannot be altered, supporting audits and investigations.

**Compliance checks and reports are automated**, so you can meet standards like GDPR or SOC 2 without manual effort. *Understand the term*: Automated compliance means the system continuously checks and documents adherence to regulatory standards.

**Only verified containers are promoted to production enclaves**, blocking supply-chain attacks before they reach your cloud. *Understand the term*: Verified containers are checked for authenticity and security before being deployed, reducing risk from compromised software.

**The Bottom Line:** dstack gives you secure, scalable, and compliant cloud deployments with simple tools and strong guarantees. Move fast, stay safe, and keep your workflows familiar.
