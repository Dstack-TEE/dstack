# dstack Platform Introduction

This introduction will help you understand what dstack is, how it works, and why it matters for building secure applications in Web3. If you are new to confidential computing, this page will walk you through the main concepts in simple language.

## What is dstack?

dstack is a platform that helps you run your applications securely by using special hardware protections called Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These protections make sure your app and its data are kept private, even from cloud providers or system administrators. With dstack, you don’t have to trust anyone except the hardware itself, and you can always prove that your app is running safely.

## Why is dstack needed?

In today’s world, running apps on the cloud or public blockchains comes with risks—your code and data can be exposed if someone gains access to the servers or infrastructure. Web3 introduces new challenges because apps are decentralized, and you can’t just rely on one company or admin to keep things secure. dstack addresses this by using TEEs to create a protected “bubble” for your app to run in, where everything is encrypted and verifiable.

## The Basics of Zero Trust in Web3

Zero trust means no part of the system is automatically trusted. Everything has to prove it is safe. For Web3, this means: 
- Application code can’t be changed once it’s deployed, unless everyone agrees and the change is recorded publicly.
- Nobody should be able to control or block access to your data or app.
- Every part of the system, from the code to the hardware, should be verifiable by anyone.
- The system assumes that attacks will happen, so it is designed to keep problems contained if something goes wrong.

dstack was created to follow these ideas, so you get privacy, integrity, and verifiability without needing to trust any central authority.

## What are TEEs, and what are their limitations?

Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a kind of hardware security built into modern processors, like Intel TDX or AMD SEV. They let your code and data run inside a protected, encrypted space that other parts of the system can’t access. This is great for privacy, but TEEs also have some challenges:
- Some security bugs can be found in the hardware, which means extra protection is needed.
- Sometimes encryption keys are tied to one machine, making it risky if that machine fails or is attacked.
- Most TEE systems depend on big vendors, which can be a single point of failure.
- Current TEEs can prove the hardware and code are genuine, but it’s harder to prove exactly how your app behaves.

dstack solves these problems by making your secure app portable, easier to manage, and more transparent.

## dstack’s Main Innovations

dstack is designed to improve on basic TEEs in three big ways.

First, it makes confidential containers portable. That means your secure app can move between different hardware or cloud providers without losing security. This is done using dstack’s key management service (dstack-kms), which keeps your encryption keys controlled by the blockchain rather than any one machine, and a small operating system (dstack-os) that works across many platforms.

Second, dstack uses smart contracts for managing your app’s code. All updates, upgrades, and deployments are handled transparently and recorded on-chain, so everyone can see what’s running and when changes happen. This keeps everything auditable and follows the principle that “code is law.”

Third, dstack creates verifiable security for your web app’s domains, using a protocol called Zero Trust TLS. This lets users connect securely to your app, knowing for sure that it’s running in a genuine TEE and hasn’t been tampered with.

## How does dstack’s architecture work?

To keep things simple, here’s how dstack is put together:

- At the bottom, there is the physical hardware with TEE support, running standard Linux and virtualization tools.
- On top of this, dstack runs its own system for managing confidential virtual machines, secure network gateways, key management, and a minimal operating system for running your apps.
- Your app runs as a standard container—no need to change your code.
- Everything about how your app is launched, upgraded, and kept secure is managed by smart contracts and can be verified by anyone.

## Key Components in Simple Terms

- **dstack-os:** The minimal operating system that provides a secure, reproducible environment for your app. It checks everything from boot to runtime, making sure nothing has been tampered with.
- **dstack-kms:** Handles all your encryption keys in a way that isn’t tied to just one machine. The rules for using and rotating keys are managed by smart contracts.
- **dstack-gateway and dstack-ingress:** These provide secure web access to your app and handle domain verification. They make sure your app is only accessible via secure, encrypted connections and that users can check the app is genuine.
- **Smart Contracts:** Control who can deploy, upgrade, or access your app. All decisions and updates are recorded publicly.

## How does dstack keep everything safe?

dstack uses a layered security approach:
- The hardware creates a private “bubble” for your app and encrypts all memory.
- The operating system checks itself every time it starts up, making sure nothing has changed.
- Remote attestation lets you (and anyone else) verify that your app is running in a genuine, secure environment.
- All permissions are limited as much as possible, so no part of the system can do more than it’s supposed to.
- All rules, code versions, and upgrades are managed with cryptographic proof, not just trust.

## What can you do with dstack?

dstack is useful for any situation where you need to keep data private or prove that your app is trustworthy. This includes analyzing sensitive data, running private AI models, doing multi-party computation without exposing information, and showing regulators or partners that you follow strict privacy rules.
