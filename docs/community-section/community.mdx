# Community & Ecosystem

The dstack community is open to anyone interested in confidential computing. You can get involved by asking questions, contributing code or docs, joining discussions, or helping with governance. We value transparency, technical skill, and collaboration.

dstack is open source and depends on its community. We bring together people from research, industry, and independent backgrounds to solve real-world problems in confidential computing. Our goal is to connect theory and practice, and to help each other learn and build.

If you want to help, you can:
- Join technical working groups (security, platform, hardware, docs)
- Take part in governance (steering committee, security board, community council, token holders)

## Communication Channels

You can reach the community through:
- Discord: chat and support
- GitHub Discussions: technical Q&A and proposals
- Telegram: quick questions and developer chat
