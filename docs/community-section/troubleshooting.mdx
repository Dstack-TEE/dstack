# Troubleshooting Dstack Components and Systems

Dstack provides a comprehensive troubleshooting framework across its components, including structured logging, diagnostic commands, web dashboards, and specific error resolution guides.

---

## 🧭 Overview of Troubleshooting Framework

- Structured CLI tools for direct diagnostics  
- HTTP API endpoints for log and status access  
- Web dashboards for real-time and historical monitoring  
- Consistent error handling and logging patterns across all components

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Commands and Tools

### VMM CLI Tool

The primary diagnostic utility is `vmm-cli.py`, which offers:

#### VM Management & Monitoring
- `lsvm` – List all VMs and their status  
- `logs` – Show VM logs (supports `--follow` and line count options)  
- `start` / `stop` / `remove` – VM lifecycle commands  

#### Resource Monitoring
- `lsimage` – List available images  
- `lsgpu` – List GPUs and availability status  

---

### 📋 Container Log Access

You can access container logs via HTTP endpoints with flexible parameters:

- **Parameters:**  
  - `since` / `until`: Time-based filtering (e.g., `"30s"`, `"5m"`, `"2h"`, `"1d"`)  
  - `follow`: Continuous streaming  
  - `text` / `bare`: Output formatting  
  - `timestamps`: Include timestamps  
  - `ansi`: ANSI color control  

---

## 📑 Logging and Error Handling

### Structured Logging

All components use the `tracing` framework for structured logs and environment-based filtering.

### Error Handling Patterns

- Uses `anyhow::Result` for error handling and context propagation  
- Process management reports detailed exit codes and failure states  

---

## 🚨 Common Errors and Resolutions

### 1. Unix Socket CID Conflicts

**Error:**  
`vhost-vsock: unable to set guest cid: Address already in use`

**Diagnosis:**  
```bash
ps aux | grep 'guest-cid='
````

**Resolution:**
Configure a new CID range in `vmm.toml` or `build-config.sh`.

---

### 2. CVM Status Issues

**Error:**
CVM status turns to `exited` immediately

**Diagnosis:**
Check stderr output by appending `ch=stderr` to your log URL.

**Common Cause:**
Permission denied for KVM kernel module

**Resolution:**
Ensure the user belongs to `libvirt` and `kvm` groups.

---

### 3. Guest Image Build Errors

**Error:**
`Operation not permitted` during image building

**Cause:**
Ubuntu 23.10+ restricts unprivileged user namespaces

**Resolution:**

```bash
sudo sysctl kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0
```

---

## 🖥️ Web Dashboard Diagnostics

### VMM Console

* Monitor VM status/configuration
* Real-time log viewing (supports follow)
* Manage container status
* Monitor resource utilization

### Gateway Dashboard

* Wireguard IP address monitoring
* Node connection status
* TLS certificate management

---

## 📡 Advanced Monitoring

### Certificate Transparency Monitoring

The `ct_monitor` tool provides:

* Tracking CT logs for unauthorized certificates
* Validating certs against known gateway public keys
* Alerts on certificate mismatches

### VM Event Reporting

Tracks:

* Boot/shutdown progress
* Errors
* Instance info updates

---

## 📂 Log File Locations & Output Redirection

* Supervisor handles output redirection and error logs
* Automatic creation of parent log directories
* Errors are logged with full context

---

## 📝 Notes

The dstack troubleshooting system layers multiple diagnostic approaches—from CLI tools and APIs to web dashboards. Structured logging via `tracing` and consistent error handling ensure that most issues have actionable diagnostic steps and clear, documented resolutions. Both real-time and historical monitoring are supported for thorough, efficient troubleshooting.
