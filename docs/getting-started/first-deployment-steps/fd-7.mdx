## Step 7: Monitor Your Application

### View Logs

From the dashboard:
1. Click on your deployment
2. Go to the **"Logs"** tab
3. You'll see real-time application logs

From the CLI:
```bash
# Stream logs
dstack logs -f my-first-app

# Get last 100 lines
dstack logs --tail 100 my-first-app
```

### Check Metrics

The dashboard provides metrics including:
- CPU usage
- Memory consumption
- Network I/O
- Request count

## Common Issues and Solutions

<details>
<summary>Application fails to start</summary>

1. Check logs for errors:
   ```bash
   dstack logs my-first-app
   ```

2. Verify your Docker image works locally:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Ensure health checks are configured correctly


#### Cannot access application URL

1. Check if the application is running:
   ```bash
   dstack status my-first-app
   ```

2. Verify network connectivity:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://my-first-app.app.example.com
   ```

3. Check gateway logs:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u dstack-gateway -f
   ```

Attestation verification fails

1. Ensure you're using the correct endpoint
2. Check if the CVM is fully initialized
3. Verify TDX is enabled on your hardware
