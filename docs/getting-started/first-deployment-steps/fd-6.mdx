## Step 6: Verify Security

One of dstack's key features is verifiable security. Let's verify your application is running in a genuine TEE.

### Get Attestation Quote

Using the dstack SDK:

```javascript
// verify-deployment.js
const { DstackClient } = require('@phala/dstack-sdk');

async function verifyDeployment() {
  const client = new DstackClient({
    endpoint: 'https://my-first-app.app.example.com'
  });
  
  // Get attestation quote
  const quote = await client.getQuote();
  console.log('Attestation Quote:', quote);
  
  // Get application info
  const info = await client.info();
  console.log('Application Info:', info);
}

verifyDeployment();
```


### Verify via Web Interface

1. In the dashboard, click on your deployment
2. Navigate to the **"Security"** tab
3. Click **"View Attestation Report"**
4. You can also verify using the [TEE Attestation Explorer](https://ra-quote-explorer.vercel.app/)
