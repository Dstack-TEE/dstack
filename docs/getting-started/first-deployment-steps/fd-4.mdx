## Step 4: Deploy via CLI (Alternative)

If you prefer the command line:

```bash
# Deploy using dstack CLI
dstack deploy \
  --name my-first-app \
  --compose docker-compose.yml \
  --wait

# Check deployment status
dstack status my-first-app
```

Expected output:
```
Deployment: my-first-app
Status: Running
CVM ID: cvm-abc123
Created: 2024-01-15 10:30:00
Endpoints:
  - http://my-first-app.app.example.com
```
