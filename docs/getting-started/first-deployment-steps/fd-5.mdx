## Step 5: Access Your Application

Once deployed, your application is accessible through the dstack gateway.

### Find Your Application URL

1. In the dashboard, click on your deployment
2. Look for the **"Endpoints"** section
3. You'll see URLs like:
   - Internal: `http://cvm-abc123.local:8080`
   - External: `https://my-first-app.app.example.com`

### Test Your Application

```bash
# Test the application
curl https://my-first-app.app.example.com

# Expected response:
{
  "message": "Hello from dstack! ðŸ”’",
  "secure": "Running in a Trusted Execution Environment",
  "hostname": "cvm-abc123",
  "environment": "production"
}
```
