Welcome to dStack, a platform designed to provide a secure environment for deploying containerized applications with hardware-backed security guarantees. Before diving into deployment, it’s essential to understand the core components and the structure of the dstack repository. This guide will walk you through the key elements and directories that make up the dstack ecosystem, all hosted at the main repository [https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/). Each section below links directly to the relevant directory in the repository, helping you explore the packages and systems that power this Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) platform.

## Core Components of dStack

The dstack platform is built on several critical components that work together to ensure secure, hardware-backed application deployment. Here’s an overview of these foundational pieces:

- **dstack-vmm** ([vmm/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/vmm)): This component runs on the bare-metal TDX host and is responsible for managing Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs). It handles their lifecycle—from creation to termination—and serves as the foundational layer for secure workload execution within the dstack environment.

- **dstack-gateway** ([gateway/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/gateway)): Acting as a secure reverse proxy, this service forwards incoming TLS connections from external clients to the appropriate CVMs. It ensures encrypted communication and controlled access, making it a vital part of the platform’s security architecture.

- **dstack-kms** ([kms/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/kms)): The Key Management Service (KMS) for dstack generates, stores, and manages cryptographic keys for CVMs. It plays an integral role in the attestation and key provisioning processes, ensuring that security credentials are handled securely.

- **dstack-guest-agent** ([guest-agent/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/guest-agent)): Running inside each CVM, this agent handles key derivation requests from containers, facilitates attestation, and bridges the guest environment with the broader dstack security infrastructure.

- **meta-dstack**: This is a Yocto meta layer used to build custom CVM guest images. It provides recipes and configurations to create minimal, secure operating system images tailored for confidential workloads. While it doesn’t correspond to a specific directory in the main repository, it’s a key part of the ecosystem for preparing secure environments.

These components collaborate seamlessly to deliver end-to-end security, leveraging the hardware root of trust provided by Intel TDX technology, through to application-level attestation and key management.

## Exploring the dStack Repository

The dstack repository is a comprehensive collection of tools, libraries, and services that support the platform’s mission of secure application deployment. Below, we’ll explore the various directories and their purposes, each linked to its location in the repository for easy reference. This structure represents the full scope of the dstack TEE platform.

The [vmm/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/vmm) directory houses the service that manages Confidential VMs on a bare TDX host, as described earlier. Complementing this, the [gateway/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/gateway) directory contains the reverse proxy that secures TLS connections to CVMs. The [kms/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/kms) directory provides the KMS server for key generation and management, while [guest-agent/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/guest-agent) includes the service running inside CVMs to support container operations.

For system setup and security tasks, [dstack-util/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/dstack-util) offers a CLI tool used within the guest environment for tasks like TDX quote generation, Runtime Measurement Register (RTMR) extension, and RA-TLS certificate generation. Remote attestation is a big part of dstack’s security model, supported by libraries like [ra-rpc/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/ra-rpc) for Protocol Buffers RPC (pRPC) and [ra-tls/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/ra-tls) for secure communication.

Attestation-specific functionality is further enhanced by [tdx-attest/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/tdx-attest), a guest library for obtaining TDX quotes and extending RTMR, and [tdx-attest-sys/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/tdx-attest-sys), which provides low-level Rust bindings for Intel TDX attestation. Certificate management is handled through [cert-client/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/cert-client) for requesting and verifying certificates in a TEE environment, and [certbot/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/certbot) for automatic TLS certificate acquisition and renewal, specifically for the dstack-gateway. The [ct_monitor/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/ct_monitor) directory ensures certificate issuance security by monitoring Certificate Transparency logs.

Configuration and API support come from [load_config/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/load_config), a utility for loading configurations across dstack components, [guest-api/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/guest-api) for guest-to-host interactions, and [host-api/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/host-api) for managing guest environments from the host. Secure data handling is supported by [iohash/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/iohash), an I/O hashing library, while key provisioning is managed through [key-provider-client/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/key-provider-client) and its build utilities in [key-provider-build/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/key-provider-build).

Shared resources across the ecosystem are defined in [dstack-types/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/dstack-types), which contains type definitions and data structures. Communication needs are met by [http-client/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/http-client), a secure HTTP client library, and [sodiumbox/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/sodiumbox), a Rust implementation of libsodium’s sealed box encryption. Auditing and verification are supported by [cc-eventlog/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/cc-eventlog) for handling Confidential Computing event logs.

Service management within dstack is overseen by [supervisor/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/supervisor), which monitors and controls running services. Utilities like [serde-duration/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/serde-duration) provide serialization and deserialization for time durations in configurations, and [mod-tdx-guest/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/mod-tdx-guest) offers a TDX guest module for secure VM operations. For web framework integration, [rocket-vsock-listener/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/rocket-vsock-listener) implements a VSOCK listener for Rocket.

Developers can integrate with dstack using [python/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/python) for Python bindings and utilities, or the [sdk/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/sdk) directory, which includes Software Development Kits for multiple languages. Within the SDK, you’ll find [go/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/sdk/go) for Go integration, [js/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/sdk/js) for JavaScript and web applications, [python/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/sdk/python) for data science and machine learning, and [rust/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/sdk/rust) for systems programming.

Additional resources include [docs/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/docs) for platform documentation, [basefiles/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/basefiles) for base file templates used in system initialization, and [.github/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/.github) for GitHub configuration files managing CI/CD pipelines. Hardware-related utilities are found in [lspci/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/lspci) for PCI device inspection, and testing is supported by [test-scripts/](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/master/test-scripts) for validating dstack functionality.

This comprehensive structure represents the full dstack TEE platform, providing everything needed to deploy containerized applications securely, from core services to developer tools, all backed by hardware-level security guarantees.
