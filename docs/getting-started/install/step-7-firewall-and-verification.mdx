# Step 7: Harden Firewall & Verify dstack Installation

Restrict network access to only necessary ports and confirm your dstack setup is operational.

## Harden the Firewall (UFW Example)

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80,443,9080,9090/tcp
sudo ufw allow 51820/udp
sudo ufw enable
```

*UFW provides a simple way to manage Linux firewall rules.*

## Verify Installation

Run a health check against your deployed API:

```bash
curl -f https://<your-domain>/api/healthz
```

- A `200 OK` response means dstack is running and accessible.
- Visit `https://<your-domain>` to access the Web UI and begin managing deployments.

---

## Recommendations
- Only open the minimum required ports for your use case.
- Regularly review firewall rules and system logs for security.
- If you encounter issues, check logs with `journalctl -u dstack` and review previous steps.
