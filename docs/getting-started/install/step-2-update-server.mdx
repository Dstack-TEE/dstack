# Step 2: Update Your Server

Update your server so it has the latest kernel, firmware, and libraries. This helps prevent compatibility issues during dstack installation.

## Update Commands

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

*This command updates all packages and applies the latest security patches.*

## Recommendations
- Reboot your server if the kernel or major system libraries are updated.
- Check for any errors during the update process and resolve them before proceeding.
- Keeping your system up to date reduces the risk of compatibility issues during installation.
