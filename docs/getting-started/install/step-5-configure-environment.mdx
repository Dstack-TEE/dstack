# Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Create an `.env` file with your domain and email for Let's Encrypt, along with API and UI port settings.

## Create the .env File

Create the file at `/etc/dstack/.env`:

```bash
# /etc/dstack/.env
DSTACK_DOMAIN=example.com
DSTACK_EMAIL=admin@example.com    # For SSL via Let's Encrypt
DSTACK_API_PORT=9090
DSTACK_UI_PORT=9080
```

**Explanation:**
- Your domain enables HTTPS and exposes the dstack UI.
- Email is used for automatic SSL certificate provisioning.
- API and UI ports can be customized, but defaults are recommended.

---

## Recommendations
- Use a real, reachable domain for production deployments.
- Double-check your email address for Let's Encrypt notifications.
- Store the .env file securely and restrict access to root/admin users.
