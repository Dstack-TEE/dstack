# Step 6: Register dstack as a Systemd Service

Set up dstack to start automatically at boot and recover from failures by creating a systemd service.

## Create the Service File

```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/dstack.service >/dev/null <<'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=dstack Runtime
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
EnvironmentFile=/etc/dstack/.env
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/dstack run --domain $DSTACK_DOMAIN --email $DSTACK_EMAIL
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now dstack
```

**Why systemd?**
- Ensures automatic restarts
- Integrates with system logs (`journalctl`)
- Survives reboots and crash recoveries

---

## Recommendations
- Use `journalctl -u dstack` to view logs and troubleshoot issues.
- Confirm the service is running with `systemctl status dstack`.
- Adjust the service file if your dstack binary is in a different location.
