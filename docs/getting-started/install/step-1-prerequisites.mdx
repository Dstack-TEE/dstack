# Step 1: Prerequisites & System Requirements

Make sure your system matches these requirements before installing dstack:

## Hardware Requirements

- **Bare-metal server with Intel TDX**: Your hardware must support Intel TDX. Prepare your firmware using the [canonical/tdx guide](https://github.com/canonical/tdx). _Note: VMs are not supported for secure enclaves._
- **Public IPv4 address**: Required for HTTPS, API, and external access.
- **Specs**: At least **16GB RAM** & **100GB SSD**. For best results, aim for 32GB+ RAM and NVMe storage.
- **Domain name & DNS access**: You'll need a domain you can manage for Let's Encrypt and gateway access.

## Software Requirements

- **Linux kernel** 5.15+ (with TDX patches)
- **Supported OS**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (**strongly recommended**) or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Rust & Cargo**: Some dstack components are built from source. Install using the [official Rust installer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **Node.js & npm**: For contract deployment tools, install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Network & Ports

| Port  | Service   | Direction | Purpose                     |
| ----- | --------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| 9080  | Web UI    | Inbound   | dstack management interface |
| 9090  | API       | Inbound   | Application API access      |
| 443   | HTTPS     | Inbound   | Secure web/app access       |
| 80    | HTTP      | Inbound   | Redirect HTTP → HTTPS       |
| 51820 | WireGuard | In/Out    | Secure VPN for enclaves     |

## How to Check Intel TDX Support

Run these commands. If you see TDX output, your hardware is ready:

```bash
grep -E 'tdx|TDX' /proc/cpuinfo
sudo dmesg | grep -i tdx
```

## Recommendations
- Use bare-metal hardware for production workloads.
- Prepare your domain and DNS settings in advance.
- Ensure you have root or sudo access to the server.
- If you're not ready for bare-metal, try our [Super Quick Start](/docs/tutorials/super-quick-start) on Phala Cloud.
