# Step 3: Install Required Packages

To build and run dstack, your system needs Linux headers, development tools, and WireGuard for secure networking.

## Install Command

```bash
sudo apt install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential wireguard
```

*On Ubuntu, this also resolves missing modules for the latest kernel.*


## Prerequisites

- A bare metal TDX server setup following [canonical/tdx](https://github.com/canonical/tdx)
- Public IPv4 address assigned to the machine
- At least 16GB RAM, 100GB free disk space.
- A domain with DNS access if you want to set up `dstack-gateway` for Zero Trust HTTPS

## Install dependencies

```bash
# for Ubuntu 24.04
sudo apt install -y build-essential chrpath diffstat lz4 wireguard-tools xorriso
# install rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
