# Step 3: Install Required Packages

To build and run dstack, your system needs Linux headers, development tools, and WireGuard for secure networking.

## Install Command

```bash
sudo apt install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential wireguard
```

*On Ubuntu, this also resolves missing modules for the latest kernel.*

---

## Recommendations
- Double-check that the installation completes without errors.
- If you are using a custom kernel, ensure the headers match your running kernel version.
- WireGuard is required for secure enclave networking.
