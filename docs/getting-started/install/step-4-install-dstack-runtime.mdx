# Step 4: Install dstack Runtime

Install dstack using the prebuilt DEB package for a fast setup, or build from source if you need customization or want to audit the code.

## Option A – Fastest: Prebuilt DEB Package

```bash
curl -LO https://downloads.dstack.io/latest/dstack_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i dstack_amd64.deb
```

*Use this option for a quick, stable setup on a supported OS.*

## Option B – Advanced: Build from Source

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/dstackio/dstack-runtime.git dstack
```

*Use this option if you need custom builds, want to audit code, or run on less common hardware.*

## Recommendations
- Use the prebuilt package for most users on Ubuntu 22.04/24.04.
- Build from source if you require custom features or want to audit the codebase.
- After installation, verify that the `dstack` binary is available in your PATH.
