title: "Super Quick Start Guides"
description: "dstack enables you to take any Docker container and deploy it as a hardware-secured TEE application with no code changes, special SDKs, or infrastructure setup required. To get started, simply choose a tutorial that matches your technology stack, copy the provided code into your preferred code editor, and follow the tutorial steps carefully to deploy your application using the Phala CLI—a separate tool for deploying apps to Phala that uses dstack to help you become familiar with the process, as both are operationally identical. After completing a tutorial, you will be well-prepared to move on to the full deployment demo found here: (/docs/getting-started/installation).

## How These Tutorials Work

Each tutorial below is designed to get you hands-on with dstack and the Phala CLI as quickly as possible. For each stack, you'll simply copy and paste the provided code into your editor, then run the listed commands in order—no prior setup or special SDKs required. These guides are intentionally basic, so you can get comfortable with the Phala CLI workflow and see how dstack operates in practice.

Once you've completed a tutorial and are familiar with the basics, we recommend checking out the additional reading in the [recommended learning path](/docs/tutorials/index) to dive deeper into dstack's architecture and learn how to perform full production deployments.
